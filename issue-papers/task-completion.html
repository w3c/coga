			<h2>Task Completion &amp; Emotional Disabilites</h2>
			      <p>INITAL DRAFT</p>
            <p>This document an issue paper looking into the challenges and issues faced by users with emotional disabilities when completing online tasks.
            </p>
            <p>This is part of a series of issue papers written by The Cognitive and Learning Disabilities Accessibility Task Force (COGA). COGA is a joint Task Force of the<a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/"> Accessible Platform Architectures (APA) Working Group</a> and the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (WCAG WG)</a>.

            <p>Task-focused UIs are key components for engaing with Many Websites. Common tasks include: </p>
                <ul> 
                    <li>Online purchases and transactions </li>
                    <li>creating and managing user profiles </li> 
                    <li>Completing individual lessons as part of an online course</li>
                    <li>Any other examples?</li>

			<h2> Challenges for People with Emotional Disabilities</h2>
			<p>Task completion can be problematic for this user group particularly when the task requires the user to execute multiple steps over the course of multiple screens. </p>
			<p>Task completion may be problematic for users experiencing: </p>
			<ul>
				<li> Anxiety around not executing tasks correctly </li>
				<li> Anxiety around privacy </li>
				<li> Anxiety around not executing tasks correctly</li>
                <li>>User with depression who have difficulty with task completion due to apathy</li>
			</ul>

        <section>
            <h2>Proposed solutions</h2>
			<ol>
                <li>Task flow indicates the user's current location in the task flow.</li>
                <li>Task flow indicates the user’s previous and next activity.</li>
                <li>Provide mechanisms for receiving online and/or human help.</li>
                <li>Provide a mechanism for users to change, update or delete input.</li>
                <li>When appropriate, if a task is timed, provide a mechanism to extend, the amount of time givent to execute a task. WCAG 2.0 SC 2.2.1 Timing Adjustable SC</li>
                <li>When appropriate, provide a mechanism for reminding a user if a task or process has not been completed</li>

                <h2>Notes</h2>
			 <h2> Explore Object-focused vs Task-focused Design </h2>
			<p>Jeff Raskin suggests that the most important characteristic of an OOUI is that it adopts a 'noun-verb', rather than a 'verb-noun' style of interaction, and that this has several advantages in terms of usability. </p>
                <h3>Designing with Objects</h3>
			<ul>
				<li> Navigation is centered around objects—nouns, not verbs </li>
				<li> Objects are always the primary representations in the UI </li>
				<li> Actions (verbs) performed on the objects comprise the tasks </li>
                <li> Tasks are secondarily represented by actions on objects </li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Impact on User Interaction</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Users perceive and act on objects</li>
                    <li>Users can classify objects based on how they behave</li>
                    <li>In the context of what users are trying to do, all the user interface objects fit together into a coherent overall representation</li>
                </ul>
