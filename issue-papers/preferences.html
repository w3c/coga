    <h1>User Preferences</h1>
		<section><p>Technology holds the promise of being extremely flexible and the design of many systems includes the expectation that users will be able to optimize their interaction experience according to their personal preferences or accessibility requirements. Typical configurable features include color, text and icon size, sounds and mouse double click speed. More comprehensive preferences include enabling different input methods such as speech recognition or assistive technology like screen readers. Other preferences such as language or regional conventions also affect the user's interactions.</p></section><section><h2>Challenges for People with Cognitive Disabilities</h2>     
		<section> 
		<p>People with cognitive disabilities can be become daunted, or worse, completely unable to effectively use preferences to improve their experience on their own. Preference selection is often implemented by providing a range of forms with controls for enabling or choosing options for each preference. These forms can be complex in detail such audio configuration and in size given that some forms are extensive. A specific preference can be hard to locate in control panels with many options even when search and browsing are provided (e.g., Windows control Panel). As a result, some users in this group will be unable set their preferences without assistance.</p>
        <p>There are also other potential difficulties after changes to preferences are made. Changes may not be implemented immediately or further action is required for this to happen. It may also be difficult to revert to a previous setting after trialing and rejecting a particular setting.</p></section>
        <section><h3>Summary of challenges</h3>
		<p>Specific challenges for people with cognitive disabilities include: </p>
		<ul>
			<li> Too many settings and or options for each</li>
			<li> Not knowing what their preferences are given the available technical solutions </li>
			<li> Being unaware of possible solutions </li></ul></section></section><section>
            <h2>Proposed Solutions</h2>
<p>The GPII Cloud4All project includes research and development to provide tools to address many of these issues. Its is also involved in <a href="http://wiki.gpii.net/w/Standardization_Roadmap">standardization work</a> including ISO/IEC 24751, Individualized adaptability and accessibility in e-learning, education and training.</p>
