        <h1>Web Security and Privacy Technologies</h1>
<p>This document is an issue paper about the challenges and issues faced by users with cognitive disabilities when trying to use web security and privacy technologies. This is part of a series of issue papers written by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/cognitive-a11y-tf/">Cognitive and Learning Disabilities Accessibility Task Force (COGA)</a>. It is a joint Task Force of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/">Accessible Platform Architectures (APA) Working Group</a> and the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (WCAG WG)</a>. This work will be used as a base document for other work, including a road-map for improving accessibility for people with cognitive disabilities.</p>        
        <h2>Description of the Technologies</h2>
        <p>Most user interfaces are designed to help users complete tasks. However, web security and privacy technologies intentionally introduce barriers to task completion. They require users to perceive more and to do more to complete tasks. Three examples of these technologies are passwords, <abbr title="Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart">CAPTCHA</abbr>, and 2-Factor Authentication.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Passwords are words or character strings used for authentication and/or for identity confirmation.  </li>
            <li>
                <abbr title="Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart">CAPTCHA</abbr> is a website widget, which prevents automated programs from submitting a web form intended for humans, by requiring humans to pass a test. Such tests:
                <ul>
                    <li>present distorted text visually and/or aurally;</li>
                    <li>require users to enter that text into a field; and</li>
                    <li>require users to invoke a submit button.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                2-factor authentication requires a two-stage process to verify the identity of a user. The user is required to have two of three of the following factors:
                <ul>
                    <li>knowledge, e.g., password or <abbr title="Personal Identification Number">PIN</abbr>;</li>
                    <li>possession, e.g., mobile device or credit card;</li>
                    <li>inherence, e.g., fingerprint or voice print (via biometric device).</li>
                </ul>

            Challenges for People with Cognitive Disabilities
        </h2>
        <p>
            Web security and privacy technologies often block people with cognitive and/or physical disabilities who may not be able to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>discern text they are required to enter and submit;</li>
            <li>recall text or instructions they have seen or heard;</li>
            <li>follow multi-step procedures.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The scope of the problem is vast because, for examples, people with disabilities:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>are prevented from purchasing goods and registering for services on the millions of websites that employ web security and privacy technologies;</li>
            <li>may circumvent web security and privacy technologies with insecure techniques/methods;</li>
            <li>may become so frustrated working through web security and privacy technologies that they relinquish their efforts, and thereby are thwarted from purchasing goods and registering for services;</li>
            <li>may be unable to become accustomed to a web security and privacy technology because there are multiple versions of it across websites.</li>
            <li>
                may be afraid to trust a web site, thus causing them to cancel a transaction.
                <ul>
                    <li>Note: This is of particular concern for efforts to personalize web sites so they conform to users' accessibility preferences. (E.g., users may be asked whether they trust a web site in order to pass such preferences.) See:</li>

                <li>
                    Allow alternative authentication factors, such as:

                        <li>location (e.g., user's home or place of employment);</li>
                        <li>presence of a trusted family member or friend, who is detected, for examples, by a wearable biometric device or by a mobile device.</li>
                        <li>could be implemented consistently so that the interface is the same across web sites</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Develop and use a consistent interface, such as common sets of vocabulary and iconography, across web sites.</li>
                <li>Offer textual-password alternatives, such as swipe patterns or click-based graphical passwords.  </li>

            <h3>Alternative Web Security and Privacy Technologies</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Security tokens, some of which are hardware devices, can be used to make authentication easier. Security tokens are used instead of, or in addition to, other forms of authentication such as passwords. Security-token hardware devices:
                    <ul>
                        <li>include key fobs, rings, or small keypads;</li>
                        <li>can store and/or generate a digital signature, a <abbr title="Personal Identification Number">PIN</abbr>, or biometric data;</li>
                        <li>can transmit such data via a <abbr title="Universal Serial Bus">USB</abbr> connector, <abbr title="Radio-Frequency Identification">RFID</abbr>, Bluetooth wireless, or <abbr title="Near-Field Communication">NFC</abbr>.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Keygen, an element of <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>5, can be used to simplify re-authentication. After a user has completed authentication using keygen, the user will be automatically authenticated for subsequent uses of a web site or service. Thus, there will be no need for a user to re-enter authentication information.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Keygen establishes a private-key and a public-key pair.</li>
                        <li>The keygen tag designates a key-pair field in an authentication form.</li>

                                <li>a private key is encrypted and saved locally; and</li>
                                <li>a public key is signed with the private key, and is sent to the server.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>In subsequent authentication sessions, the server will either automatically retrieve the private key, or prompt the user to select it.</li>

                        A web-form honeypot that is:
                        <ul>
                            <li>an input field</li>
                            <li>hidden using <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr></li>
                            <li>labeled with a field name atypical of forms</li>
                            <li>clearly identified with instructions, for <abbr title="Assistive Technology">AT</abbr> users, and for others whom have disabled <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, not to fill it in</li>
                            <li>checked to determine if something was entered</li>
                            <li>used to reject a submission if something was entered</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Note: The web-form honeypot will not work for popular websites because spammers will likely expend the effort to defeat it.</p>
