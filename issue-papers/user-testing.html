<h1>User testing with people with learning and cognitive disabilities. </h1>
<p>Draft</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>People with cognitive and learning disabilities may be unable to use   web content because of the design choices of the author. Examples   include: </p>
<ul>
  <li>People who struggle with keeping and regaining focus, may be   unable to focus on a task if there are lots of distractions and   interruptions. They may need headers and signposts to help them regain   the context after their attention has been lost (including in   multi-media). </li>
  <li>Many groups will need support to minimize errors and   complete their task. They will struggle with complex, multi-stage   processes that were not necessary for the task at hand such as filling   out forms or entering data correctly or finding the content or feature   that they need. </li>
  <li> People with impaired short term memory are unlikely to be   able to remember passwords and access codes. They may have trouble or be   unable to remember new symbols and interface paradigms. </li>
  <li>People with language related disabilities may need simple   clear language and instructions. They may also need supporting graphics   and familiar symbols</li>
  <li>people with communication disabilities may need clear   literal language and may not understand metaphors or non-literal text   and symbols.</li>
  <li>People with dyscalculia may not understand numerical references such as percentages.  </li>
</ul>
<h3>How many people does this effect?</h3>
<p>Over half of people over 60 years old will have some sort of age   related memory impairment, including mild cognitive impairment also   known as Age-Associate Memory Impairment (AAMI). Learning and memory for   new events, and symbols slows so learning new interfaces and terms is   less successful. On the other hand most of these users will be as   proficient in other fields as they have ever been. </p>
<p>Note that the aging community is between 20 - 30% in most OECD countries and growing. <strong>This means that 10-15% of the population will have an age related memory impairment.</strong></p>
<p>Other cognitive disabilities include people with: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Language related disabilities </li>
  <li> Memory related disabilities </li>
  <li> Focus and attention related disabilities </li>
  <li> Disabilities that affect executive function and decision making </li>
</ul>
<p><br>
  <strong>Together this can effect 11% of school age people</strong></p>
<p>Also sometimes people with anxiety, depression  or under stress   have the same needs as people with cognitive and learning disabilities. <strong>This can effect 17% of the population</strong></p>
<p>User-testing with people with cognative and learning dsibalities will help your content be useable by all these groups.</p>
<h2>Who should I include in a usability study?</h2>
<p>For typical Web page content we recommend including at least two people from each of the following groups</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>People with a minor language related disabilities such as Dyslexia  </li>
  <li>People with a communication disorder such as autism</li>
  <li> People with a memory related disabilities such as MCI or early stage of dementia</li>
  <li>People with a focus and attention related disabilities such as ADD</li>
  <li>People with a problem working with numbers such as dyscalculia</li>
  <li>People with an intellectual disability such as down syndrome</li>
  <li> People with a disabilities that affect executive function and decision making such as down syndrome or dementia</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h2>The setting</h2>
<p>Additional stress of a new environment may alter the performance It is therefor recommended that some user tests are in the users home or in an environment that feels safe and familiar.</p>
<p>It is also recommended to do some group interviews and some one on one interviews, as not all participants will perform well in a group setting.</p>
<h2>What to measure</h2>
<p>According to DIN  EN ISO 9241, usability could be measured assessing the following parameters: </p>
<ul>
  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span><strong>efficacy</strong> is the extent to  which the user is able to achieve the respective goal(s). Hence, efficacy is a  relative measure, ranging from 0% to 100%. A common operationalisation of  efficacy is the percentage of tasks completed successfully by the user.</li>
  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span><strong>efficiency</strong> is the efficacy  of the user, divided by the amount of resources the user needs to spend in  order to reach this efficacy. A common measure of efficiency would therefore be  the time to complete each task.</li>
  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span><strong>satisfaction</strong> is the user&rsquo;s  &ldquo;subjective reaction&rdquo; to the interaction with the product (ISO 9241). User  satisfaction is an emotion which results from the user comparing his  expectations of the system to his actual experiences with it. Satisfaction can  therefore only be measured by asking the user about his feelings towards the  system.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following  table shows an example fror  metrics collected (used by the   SMART4MD project):</p>

<p>Based on the  experience in working  with people living with dementia, and of the nature of the user group we recommend the following additional guidelines</p>
<ol>
  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>Have a  large observer to participant ratio so you can monitor the individual  participant, where they struggle and what they say.</li>
  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>Usability  tests should be a mix of groups and one on one interview.</li>
  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>When a  participant does not manage and the observer offers help, the observer should  try and help with words and note what words were effective in helping the user  understand what to do.</li>
  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>Ask people  things about their performance during the session but we have to be aware of  their real performance during the execution of the task using quantitative  measures.</li>
  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>Ask users  to complete the task as far as they can without asking for help. If they need  they can ask their caregiver for help to complete the tasks.</li>
  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>Also try  and check if the back navigation confuses&nbsp; people</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>For each task:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>Identify  any sections were the user is struggling.<strong></strong></li>
  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>Are terms  and icons understandable? If the user needs help what term was helpful?<strong></strong></li>
  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>What  sections made the users mode improve? What sections did the user&rsquo;s mode worsen?<strong></strong></li>
  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>Ask is there something that would make this  task easier or better for yo<strong>u</strong></li>
</ol>
<h2><br>
  <strong><em>Ethical issues</em></strong></h2>
<p><br>
  <strong><em>&ldquo;Ethical  issues are not just something that needs to be taken into account in completing  application forms for ethics committees. Consideration of ethical issues should  be a feature of each stage of focus group research ….&rdquo; (Barbour, 2009, p.100)</em></strong></p>
<h3><br>
  <strong>Respecting  autonomy</strong></h3>
<p><br>
  Informed consent process <br>
  A  key condition for the conduct of ethical research is that participants have  been informed of and understand the purpose of the study and of possible harm  which might arise as a result of participation, that they have given informed  consent and that appropriate measures have been taken to minimize the  likelihood of harm occurring. Article 1 of the Declaration of Helsinki (World  Medical Association, 2000) covers respect for the autonomy of research  participants. Respect for autonomy is traditionally described as the &ldquo;the norm  of respecting the decision-making capacities of autonomous individuals&rdquo; (Beauchamp  and Childress, 2008, p.12). Where autonomy may be diminished, participants must  be protected from exploitation of their vulnerability and their dignity must be  respected (Belmont report, 1979, quoted by Mack et al., 2005). <br>
  Whilst  these documents and definitions were developed in the context of biomedical  research, non-medical research involving humans, especially those who are  vulnerable, also typically requires ethical approval, involving obtained  informed consent. The two main values governing the need to obtain informed  consent are: 1. to promote and protect the person&rsquo;s wellbeing, 2. to respect  the person&rsquo;s self-determination (Buchanan and Brock, 1990). If the planned  focus groups are considered as consultations (e.g. in the context of patient  and participant involvement) rather than research, it is likely that in most  countries, ethical approval and a formal consent process involving the  assessment of capacity would not be needed. This should be verified. However, the  consultations/focus groups are being conducted in the context of a research  project. Consequently, although a formal informed consent procedure may not be  an ethical or legal requirement, we could still consider obtaining such  consent.<br>
  Consent  can be considered valid if it has been given by a person with the necessary  capacity and provided voluntarily (not obtained under duress), based on the  provision of relevant information (e.g. full details of what is involved,  including possible risks and benefits). It is therefore important to provide  participants with the information they need to make an informed decision and  this can be achieved either verbally or in writing and either before the  consultation or on the day. Both are possible i.e. a participant information  sheet given to participants before the event and a brief presentation at the  start of the consultation. <br>
  The  participant information sheet could perhaps cover the following: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>The  aim of the project</li>
  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>The  aim of the consultation</li>
  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>Who  is in charge of the project and introduction of the group moderators</li>
  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>The  fact that it is voluntary and that people can leave at any time without having  to explain why</li>
  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>Issues  surrounding the use of the data that will be collected </li>
  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>Ground  rules and expression of gratitude to the participants</li>
</ul>
<h3>Capacity and consent </h3>
<p><br>
  Capacity  is task specific in that it relates to the ability to perform a particular  task, at a particular moment in time and under specified conditions (Buchanan  and Brock, 1990). The capacity for a particular task may, with people with  dementia, sometimes fluctuate, not only because of the dementia but also owing  to a range of factors (e.g. psychosocial, situational, medical, etc.) (Holzer  et al., 1997). However, a person either has or does not have the capacity to  consent to a particular consultation at a particular time. <br>
  If  people turn up to the focus group discussion, having read and understood the  participant information sheet and having been given the opportunity to clarify  any questions about the consultation, this could be taken as implicit consent.  Such consent could be complemented by explicit consent at the start of the  consultation when the focus group moderator runs through the information about  the consultation, explains the &ldquo;house rules&rdquo; and asks whether everyone agrees  to the recording and use of their data. Oral consent is often considered  acceptable for research with minimal risk or where a loss of confidentiality is  the primary risk (Mack et al., 2005). Sometimes, a written, signed consent form is  the actual threat to the confidentiality of data (Dubois (2008). <br>
  A  problem may arise if the moderator suspects that a person who has agreed to  participate does not fully understand the purpose of the consultation, does not  fully understand that the data (although anonymised) will be used for the  purpose of the study and/or that the discussion is being recorded. On the other  hand, it should not be assumed that a diagnosis of dementia or difficulty  communicating without the assistance of a carer means that a person lacks such  understanding. It may nevertheless be a justifiable reason to check whether the  person does have the capacity to decide whether to participate. This raises a  few questions, namely:  Will moderators  rely on information from the participant that they have dementia (i.e. if  having dementia is an inclusion criterion)? Should a person with dementia be  included if s/he seems to lack a full understanding of what is involved (e.g.  s/he may lack the capacity to consent, not understand that participation is voluntary,  not understand how the information will be used etc.)? Are moderators qualified  to assess capacity?</p>
<h3><br>
  <em>Action  points:</em></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>Find out  whether this is a  consultation and whether ethical approval and/or <u>formal</u> consent is  required.</li>
  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>If the answers to the above are &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and  &ldquo;no&rdquo; respectively, but the group agrees that informed consent should nevertheless  be sought….</li>
  <ul>
    <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>draw  up a common participant information sheet</li>
    <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>adapt  this to the cultural context of the country in which the consultation is being  carried out</li>
    <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>check  at the start of the session that everyone consents to the consultation  (participation, use of data and recording).</li>
    <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>decide  within the group what to in the case of a person possibly lacking capacity to  participate turning up for the consultation.</li>
    <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>remind  participants that they are free to leave at any time without having to justify  their decision. </li>
    <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>make  it clear that participants do not have to answer any questions they would  prefer not to.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Confidentiality  and privacy </strong></h3>
<p><br>
  Confidentiality  refers to &ldquo;the interest people have in controlling access to information or  data about them&rdquo; whereas privacy refers to &ldquo;the interest people have in  restricting the access of others to themselves&rdquo; (DuBois, 2008, p. 154). One of  the aims of a focus group is to promote self-disclosure and this is more likely  when the participants feel respected and free to give their opinions without  being judged (Krueger and Casey, 2009). This involves sharing information with  the moderator as well as with other members of the group. Participants,  researchers involved and those in the wider research group should all respect  the principle of confidentiality and take measures to protect the privacy of  participants. <br>
  Participants  should all be encouraged to contribute to the discussion and the moderator  should try to involve those who are less vocal, whilst ensuring that the more  vocal participants do not dominate the discussion at the expense of the former.  The moderator should also ensure that both the line of questioning and the  course that the discussion takes is kept well within proper boundaries. At the  same time, sensitivity is needed from the moderator to ensure that people do  not feel obliged to divulge personal information about their lives or condition  which they would prefer not to share. Small focus groups often take the form of  a fairly intimate and open discussion which may sometimes lead to  over-disclosure whereby participants go beyond their usual boundaries and  disclose information which they later regret having shared (Kvale and  Brinkmann, 2009). </p>
<h3><br>
  <em>Action points:</em></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>Explain in the participant information  sheet and on the day that the consultation is a group activity and that  consequently, information will be shared within the group and not only with the  moderator, concluding with the request that everyone treat what they see and  hear with utmost confidentiality.</li>
  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>Take necessary measures to ensure that  the data is treated with confidentiality (i.e. that information we have learned  in confidence is kept secure and private, and is not divulged to other people  without permission).</li>
  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>Hold the consultation in a place where  the participants will not be observed or overheard by passers-by. </li>
  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>(Pseud-)anonymise the data from the  consultation and remind participants that this will be done. </li>
  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>Keep the list of names and pseudonyms in  a secure location so that people other than the researchers do not have access  to it.   </li>
  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>Encourage all participants to contribute  to the discussion, whilst taking take to respect their personal boundaries in  relation to self-disclosure. </li>
  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>Ensure that participants have the  opportunity to check the transcript or summary of the discussion (and to ask  for something they said and wished they hadn&rsquo;t to be taken out – unlikely to  occur)</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Protection  from harm (non-maleficence)</strong></h3>
<p><br>
  Participants  involved in a research project must be protected from potential harm (World  Medical Association, 2000). The biomedical ethical principle of non-maleficence  is therefore relevant, namely avoiding the causation of harm (Beauchamp and  Childress, 2008). This is a fundamental requirement for the conduct of ethical  research and should ideally apply to this consultation which is part of a more  global research project. Different types of harm are possible (e.g. physical,  emotional, psychological and financial). The potential vulnerability of people  with dementia should be recognised but this should not lead to over-protection  and paternalism. Avoiding harm should be combined with promoting wellbeing  (similar to the principle of beneficence). <br>
  Avoiding  harm and promoting the wellbeing of participants also involves paying attention  to the concepts of respect, integrity, singularity/personhood, relationality  and historicity (Alzheimer Europe, 2014). Virtues such as compassion, discernment,  integrity, trustworthiness, conscience and conscientiousness are also important  in the healthcare domain, as highlighted by Beauchamp and Childress (2008), who  also suggest that some virtues (e.g. loyalty, courage, kindness and  benevolence) may at times lead to inappropriate and unacceptable  behaviour.  <br>
  Whilst  the topic of this consultation is perhaps not sensitive <em>per se</em>, participants may nevertheless touch on personal and  health-related issues linked to their private lives and relationships with  other people. The group discussion may result in issues arising (e.g. about  certain symptoms of dementia and the impact of loss of capacity) which might  lead to reflection and emotional or psychological responses (e.g. frustration,  embarrassment, shame or fear). Whilst such reactions might be expressed during  the consultation, for some participants they may be experienced later. Barbour  (2009) suggests the need to have relevant contact numbers at hand so that  researchers do not &ldquo;simply grab the data and run&rdquo; (p.92). Ideally, participants  should leave the consultation not only &ldquo;unharmed&rdquo; but also feeling good about  have been heard and having contributed towards something important. <br>
  Participants  may also disclose information which has ethical implications such as possible  abuse (Smith, 1995). Moderators will need to consider beforehand how to deal  with such information, should this situation arise. </p>
<h3><br>
  <em>Action  points:</em></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>Go through the &ldquo;ground rules&rdquo; at the  beginning of the consultation and have them on a flip chart or printout to  remind participants. </li>
  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>Avoid the use of derogatory terms such as  &ldquo;demented&rdquo; when interacting with people with dementia and reporting findings; </li>
  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>Do your best to handle emotional and  psychological reactions, recognising the potential vulnerability of some of the  participants</li>
  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>Be careful not to adopt a  psychotherapeutic role for which you are not equipped. A sensitive and  compassionate approach is needed, however, to avoid appearing cold and aloof  (Kvale and Brinkmann, 2009).</li>
  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>Reflect on your understanding and  perception of dementia (see Alzheimer Europe&rsquo;s 2013 report on the ethical  issues linked to the perceptions and portrayal of dementia)</li>
  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>Consider each person in their entirety,  recognising that they have a past and a current life and that this might not be  immediately apparent but it is part of who and what they are.</li>
  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>Avoid reducing people solely to their condition. People with dementia <em>have</em> dementia but each person is more than their dementia. </li>
  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>Try to ensure that participants&rsquo; rights, needs  and dignity are respected but avoid being over-protective.</li>
  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>Make time for a debriefing with the  participants including the provision of contact details of a person or  organisation (e.g. local Alzheimer association) in a position either directly  or indirectly to offer support. Bring along leaflets and/or your own business  card to facilitate future contact from participants.</li>
  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>Send a summary/feedback to participants  once the consultation is finished, preferably in the form of a written report.</li>
