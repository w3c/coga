        THIS ISSUE PAPER IS A WORK IN PROGRESS
		<section>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Any standards for help? (Did not find help specific standards. There is a list of help authoring tools. Would this be of value? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_help_authoring_tools)</li>
				<li>Context sensitive or general help (Suggestion - define context sensitive help -  Context-sensitive help is online help that is provided at a specific point in the state of the software, providing help for the situation that is associated with that state.)</li>
			</ul>
		</section>
        <section>
			<h2>Challenges for People with Cognitive Disabilities</h2>
            <p>Can be critical (Should this be added to the list below?)</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Often need real person (use "human" instead of "real person") help - on demand</li>
				<li>Can get lost - how to close help and continue.(Suggested - May be easy for a user to get lost. Additional list item - May be unclear how to close help and continue.)</li>
				<li>May have to remember help, close it (Suggested - close help mechanism) and perform actions</li>
			</ul>
		</section>
        <section>
			<h2>Settings</h2>
				<p>Different potential types of symbols and language support for help text and key content</p>
				<p>As a first step I am trying to determine different use cases and potential settings (this seems like a note. Can I change tone or delete)</p>

				<h3>Types of Language Support</h3>
                <section>
                    <h4>Restricted Vocabulary</h4>
                    <p>Language may be restricted to a given vocabulary, or a subset of that vocabulary. When words are outside the known language, an  explanation should be provided using known words.
 </p>
                    <p>Further, specific jargons can be added if they are known to the user</p>
                    <p>For example: options - one of the following:(can the word "options" be removed from this phrase as it is clear that the following are options)</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Restricted vocabulary such as Globis (Is a reference to Globis needed?)</li>
                        <li>Restricted such as Globish 100 most common words</li>
                        <li>Restricted such as Globish 500 most common words + Easy Web Jargon lexicon. (Is a reference to Easy Web Jargon lexicon needed?)</li>
                     </ol>
                </section>
                <section>

                        <li>Active voicing when possible</li>
                        <li>Number free when possible. Avoid, or give an alternative for use of numerals, text for numerals and numerical concepts</li>
                        <li>Small chunks (short sentences, paragraphs etc.)</li>
                     </ol>

			<h2>Notes</h2>
			<ul>
				<li> Help should be easy to find and displayed on demand </li>

                    <ul>
