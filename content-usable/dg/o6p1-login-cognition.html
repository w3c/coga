  <h5 class="coga-5">What to Do</h5>
  <p>
    Users can login, register, and reset credentials, without having more
    cognitive abilities then they need to use a simple web page. They do not
    have to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>memorize character strings,</li>
    <li>perform calculations,</li>
    <li>copy content,</li>
    <li>answer puzzles,</li>
    <li>reliably reproduce gestures, or</li>
    <li>
      recognize characters presented on screen, and then enter them into an
      input field.
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section>
  <h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
  <p>
    People with <a>memory impairments</a> often forget their passwords and are
    not able to login. Their solutions often are only sometimes helpful and have
    security risks:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      They may have to look at or listen to text several times to copy or type
      it into a form field.
    </li>
    <li>
      They may reuse a single password or use a simple-to-remember password,
      which they can remember.
    </li>
    <li>
      If they need to change their password or use a complicated password they
      may store passwords insecurely, such as written on pieces of paper which
      other people can see.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>They may also struggle with other steps during login, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>entering characters in the correct order,</li>
    <li>
      entering characters correctly with a limited number of tries (resulting in
      being locked out),
    </li>
    <li>finding a PIN,</li>
    <li>working out puzzles or distorted letters,</li>

    <li>copy characters correctly from another device.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Users can stop after getting frustrated with time-limited procedures or
    presentations of digital security tokens. Or they can be locked out of vital
    services because of their disability.
  </p>
  <p>
    Without this design requirement, many people cannot use an application or
    content at all. See
    <a href="https://w3c.github.io/coga/issue-papers/privacy-security.html"
      >Security and Privacy Technologies</a
    >
    issue paper for the full description of this issue, and how it stops people
    from using web services that are often critical. For example, many people
    cannot make doctors’ appointments, etc., by themselves. This may be partly
    responsible for the reduced life expectancy of people with learning and
    cognitive disabilities.

<section>
  <h5 class="coga-5">More Details</h5>
  <p>There are many ways to meet this design pattern:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Use
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/"
        >Web Authentication: An
        <abbr title="application programming interface">API</abbr> for accessing
        Public Key Credentials</a
      >
      [[webauthn-2]] to support inclusive alternatives that do not rely on
      typical cognitive abilities. For example, hardware authentication devices,
      smartcard or FIDO.
    </li>
    <li>
      Provide automatic user authentication based upon the use of a trusted
      device (to which the user has already logged in with their own identity).
      The user does not have to transcribe characters, but may have to press a
      link to identify they have the device.
    </li>
    <li>Allow a biometrics option.</li>
    <li>
      Use a system the user is already logged into via third-party
      authentication services (e.g., OAuth etc.).
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Methods of meeting requirements for alternative user authentication would
    include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Clicking a link sent to an email address or a phone number. (Note that
      this is easy to implement and may be useful for minimal security, such as
      allowing comments on a blog.)
    </li>
    <li>
      Logging in by using information present in users’ personal documentation,
      such as the total number of a current account balance, with explanation on
      how to find this information.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h5 class="coga-5">Examples</h5>

  <p><span class="use"></span><strong>Use:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/"
        >Web Authentication: An
        <abbr title="application programming interface">API</abbr> for accessing
        Public Key Credentials</a
      >
      [[webauthn-2]].
    </li>
    <li>
      Single Sign-on (SSO) that allow users to access many sites with a single
      login (federated login).
    </li>
    <li>Two step authentication with Bluetooth links (no copying).</li>
    <li>Quick Response Codes (QR Code).</li>
  </ol>
  <p><span class="avoid"></span><strong>Avoid:</strong></p>

  <ol>
    <li>Using two-step authentication that requires copying.</li>
    <li>Using a password and not allowing pasting into the field.</li>
  </ol>
