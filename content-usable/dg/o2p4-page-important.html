  <h5 class="coga-5">What to Do</h5>
  <p>
    Make key content visually stand out. Key content should be visible to users
    without needing to scroll the page or hover over content. This includes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>critical tasks and the controls needed to complete them,</li>
    <li>
      interactions for critical features (e.g. login forms, send buttons), and
    </li>
    <li>
      important information (e.g. health warnings or information that can affect
      safety).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
  <p>
    Slow readers, people with impaired <a>executive function</a>, impaired
    memory, and other <a>cognitive and learning disabilities</a> may not be able
    to find the information and features on a page. For example, content that
    requires a lot of reading or the use of the scroll bar or pointer hovers may
    be hard to find. Other users cannot find content that requires paging
    through different screens
  </p>
  <p>
    Users who are unfamiliar with the page (or common design patterns) may rely
    on prominent visual styling aids to find important information. A clear
    heading structure can also help with this by reducing what needs to be read.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, an elementary school publishes a weekly newsletter with
    stories, activities, and important announcements. One important announcement
    is that school will end early one day. The newsletter has less important
    information before the early school dismissal, and does not have a warning
    symbol next to the important information. A parent who reads slowly may need
    to stop before the important information and does not find out that the
    school is ending early one day. The parent is not home for the child on
    time.
  </p>
  <p>
    In another example, a user is writing a comment, but the send button is not
    visible when the focus is on the text area. As a result, she cannot see how
    to send her feedback. The company will then not receive any feedback from
    groups who unable to find the feedback button.

  <h5 class="coga-5">More Details</h5>
  <p>
    The amount of page visible before scrolling is dependent on a wide range of
    factors such as physical device size and resolution. Where possible, use
    site statistics to understand what technology users are using. Keep this in
    mind when designing the page.
  </p>
  <p>
    Consider the most constrained user experience first (e.g., a 240px wide
    mobile phone) and then design upwards from there. This will account for the
    widest range of scenarios. Adopting responsive development practices can
    improve the flexibility of the page for more devices and situations.

  <h5 class="coga-5">Getting Started</h5>
  <p>
    Make it easy to find the most important things on the page. Identify key
    content and its placement early in the design process.
  </p>
  <p>
    Space at the top of the document is most likely to be visible to users
    without scrolling. Place key content at the top of the page to give the best
    experience to the widest range of users.
