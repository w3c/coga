			<h1>Introduction</h1>

			<p>Making websites and applications that are friendly for people with cognitive impairments affects every part of design and development.</p>
			<p>Traditionally accessibility has been most focused on the interface, and making that usable for people with sensory and physical impairments in vision, hearing and/or mobility. Some accessibility features will help people with cognitive impairments, but often the issues are about context, language, usability, and other more general factors that impact everyone to some degree.</p>
			<p>This document aims to provide guidance on how to make websites and applications that are friendly for people with cognitive impairments by providing guidance for your designs, and design process.</p>

			<section id="process">
				<h2>Process</h2>
				<p>Some aspects of making things friendly for people with cognitive impairments are best dealt with as part of the overall design process. For most organizations there should be scope for taking a <a href="https://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/user-centered-design.html">user-centred design process</a>.</p>
				<p>Key parts of this process for people with cognitive impairments should be:</p>
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Including cognitive issues in the context of use and requirements;
						</li>
						<li>
							Including people with cognitive issues in research methods such as usability testing.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>If people with cognitive impairments are included in the usability testing and their feedback is accounted for, you can be sure that the website will be easier to use for everyone. (See <a href="#testing_groups_feedback">Usability testing</a>, below)</p>
			</section>

			<section id="scale">
				<h2>Applicability across websites</h2>
				<p>How much effort an organization should expend on making a website friendly for people with cognitive impairments will vary. For organizations that provide public services, or are national (or international) private service providers and already conduct user-research, they should:</p>
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Include people with learning and cognitive disabilities as part of user research such as usability-testing;
						</li>
						<li>
							Review designs and early stage development with the design themes in this document.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>For organizations that do not include usability testing as part of the process, they could use this document to review designs and implementations.</p>

		<section id="background">
			<h1>Background about people with learning and cognitive disabilities and the web</h1>
			<p>People with cognitive and learning disabilities may be unable to use web content because of the design choices of the author. Examples include: </p>
				<ul>
					<li> People with impaired short term memory are unlikely to be able to remember passwords and access codes. They may have trouble or be unable to remember new symbols and interface paradigms. </li>
					<li>People with language related disabilities may need simple clear language and instructions. They may also need supporting graphics and familiar symbols</li>
					<li>People with communication disabilities may need clear literal language and may not understand metaphors or non-literal text and symbols. </li>
					<li>People with dyscalculia may not understand numerical references such as percentages. </li>
					<li>People who struggle with keeping and regaining focus, may be unable to focus on a task if there are lots of distractions and interruptions. They may need headers and signposts to help them regain the context after their attention has been lost (including in multi-media). </li>
					<li>Many groups will need support to minimize errors and complete their task. They will struggle with complex, multi-stage processes that were not necessary for the task at hand such  as filling out forms or entering data correctly or finding the content or feature that they need. </li>
			</ul>
					</section>

		<section id="user_needs">
			<h1>User Needs</h1>
			<p>User needs for people with learning and cognitive disabilities (COGA) are often important for other users.

		</section>

		<section id="persona">
			<h1>Use Cases / Persona</h1>
			<p>Any time there is a 'target audience', there will be people with with learning and cognitive disabilities in that audience. Cogntiive issues are often invisible in day to day life until people encounter particular challenges. To provide some context and understanding eight personas have been created which outline fictional people with various cognitive issues and the challenges they face.</p>

			<h1>Usability Testing, Focus Groups and Feedback</h1>
			<p>Usability testing is the best way to know if your content and functionality works for real people with cognitive and learning disabilities.</p>
			<div><img alt="aspects for providing guidance, include usability, accessibility, reliably testable accessibility and automatically testable accessibility " src="img/guidance_aspect.png" height="486" width="600"></div>
			<p>Usability is a key factor for everyone, if something is difficult to use it is cannot be accessible. Automated testing for accessibility tends to focus on more technical areas of accessibility, and cannot assess how easy something is to use. It is vital for people with cognitive disabilities that teams do not rely on automated testing for accessibility, but incorporate <a href="#design_themes">design requirements</a>, and if possible test with people who have cognitive disabilities.</p>
			<p>Finding people to include in usability testing who have different learning and cognitive disabilities can be relatively easy, such as friends, colleagues, relatives or neighbors who:</p>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Are older and struggle to use computers, or have age-related forgetfulness;
					</li>
					<li>
						Are at an early stage of dementia
					</li>
					<li>
						Have dyslexia, dyscalculia or ADHD
					</li>
					<li>
						Have a learning or intellectual disability
					</li>
					<li>
						People with acquired cognitive issues (for example, due to neurological trauma) who have the same challenges as people with other disabilities such as: 
						<ul>
							<li>having difficulty (asking a family member to help) with booking travel booking or hotel booking online</li>
							<li>being unable to use online banking</li>
							<li>coping with content forms and pop up windows when errors occur</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>It is beyond the scope of this document to provide a guide to usability testing and user-research, however, there are many resources available such as:</p>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<a href="https://uxmastery.com/beginners-guide-to-usability-testing/">How to Conduct Usability Testing from Start to Finish</a>, from UX Mastery.

			</p>
			<section id="differences_testing">
				<h2>Differences from usability testing with the general population</h2>
				<p>There are some differences when testing for accessibility, and that includes when testing with people who have cognitive impairments:</p>
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Ensure that the participation forms are easy to understand, send them to the participant in advance, and allow plenty of time for the participant to ask questions and fill in forms;</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Allow the participant to bring a carer, family member or friend to attend with them. If your tester has a guardian you should get informed consent from both the tester and their guardian;</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>It helps to provide easy methods of assessing mood, rather than asking for the participant to verbalise, try asking them to select a smiley face, such as:<br />
							<figure><img src="img/faces-happy-to-sad.png" width="200" alt="a set of 5 smiley faces from happy, through neutral, to sad." /></figure></p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Ensure the person does not feel like they are at fault for making mistakes; this is a likely scenario for people with cognitive impairments.</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p class="ednote">The next few paragraphs up to the next section may be removed as it is both covered in usability guidance in the links above and significantly incomplete in comparison. We would be interested in finding out if anyone finds it useful to include.</p>
				<p>Some brief guidance on usability testing:</p>
				<p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							Can your users ( people with learning and cognitive disabilities)  manage each task reasonably easily and fast. You can time the task taken to complete, and note any parts that where the users are slowed down or seem to struggle. Also note any errors that they making including clicking on the wrong thing.
						</li>
						<li>
							Is completing the task frustrating or upsetting?
							<ol>
								<li>You can ask the users how they are feeling before and after the tasks (or rate their mode such as selecting the smilly which represents how they feel, such as:</li>
								<li>ask them if anything was annoying.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>How can you make it better for your users ( people with learning and cognitive disabilities)</p>
							<ol>
								<li>You can analyze the data collected above</li>
								<li>ask them how they feel about the system and if anything was annoying.</li>
							</ol>
							<p>If the user if failing blame the designer and not the user. Such as “ it is so helpful that you are doing this because our designers are not very good, or are always playing computer games so they think everyone is good at this stuff” or “you are really helping us make  this useable by real people and not just engineers” . Stop the process if users are getting distressed despite this.</p>
						</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
				<p>As a short overview, usability could be measured based on efficacy, efficiency and satisfaction. This can be done by measuring or tracking: </p>
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li>successes and noting any errors to measure efficacy,</li>
						<li>time taken per task to measure efficiency, note that the relative time between tasks is often more useful than absolute numbers. and</li>
						<li>user’s mood and comments to measure satisfaction.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>At the end of the evaluation you should be able to answer:</p>
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li>What prevents the user from completing a task?</li>
						<li>What creates confusion? When and why do they misinterpret the interface?</li>
						<li>What produces an error and an incorrect action?</li>
						<li>When does the user get frustrated or upset</li>
						<li>When does the user misunderstand navigation, menus and controls?</li>
						<li>How can these problems be avoided?</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>Note you will need to get informed consent from the tester before testing. Explain what they will be doing and why it is helping you. If there are any risks they need to be explained and understood. If your tester has a guardian you should get informed consent from both the tester and their guardian. Make sure potential participants are aware they can withdraw from the testing situation at any time and that their comments will be anonymised before being used in any report.</p>

		<section id="design_themes">
			<h1>Design Requirement Themes</h1>
			<p>To help web content providers meet the needs of people with cognitive and learning disabilities we have identified the following themes:</p>
			<p>
				<ol>
					<li><p><strong>Design so that as many users as possible understand the site and know how to use it. </strong>This often involves using things that are clear and familiar to the user so that they do not have to learn new symbols, terms or design patterns. Personalization and good use of semantics can help make the symbols and design as familiar to the user as possible. People with cognitive disabilities rely upon predictable behavior in digital content. For example, many websites do not follow the standard convention for hyperlinks: blue = unvisited; purple = visited; and underlined. See the <a href="coga-designrequirements.html#theme1">design requirments for understandable design</a>.</p></li>
					<li><p><strong>Help the user find what they need. </strong>Navigating the system should be easy.  See the <a href="coga-designrequirements.html#theme2">design requirments for navigation</a>.</p></li>
					<li><p><strong>Use clear and understandable content</strong> This includes clear text, clear images, speech, and easy to understand video.  See the <a href="coga-designrequirements.html#theme3">design requirments for understandable content.</a></p></li>
					<li><p><strong>Prevent the user from making mistakes and make it easy to correct mistakes when they do occur.</strong> A good design and use of scripts will make errors less likely, but when they do occur the user should know how to correct them, without having to render other data or start from the beginning. See the <a href="coga-designrequirements.html#theme4">design requirments for errors.</a></p></li>
					<li><p><strong>Help the user focus and restore context if attention is lost.</strong> Items like breadcrumbs can help orientate the user and help the user restore the context when it is lost. (Making breadcrumbs clickable can also help the user undo mistakes.) See the <a href="coga-designrequirements.html#theme5">design requirments for focus.</a></p></li>
					<li><p><strong>Minimize the cognitive skills required to use the content and avoid barriers</strong> that stop people with cognitive disabilities from using content, such as hard to use security mechanisms. When possible, provide more accessible options. See the <a href="coga-designrequirements.html#theme6">design requirments for barriers.</a></p></li>
					<li><p><strong>Provide help and support.</strong> Graphics, summaries of long documents, adding  icons to headings and links are all examples of extra help and support.  See the <a href="coga-designrequirements.html#theme7">design requirments for support.</a></p></li>
					<li><p><strong>Feedback is usable by everyone.</strong> If users have difficulty sending  feedback then you will not know if they are able to use the content or when they are experiencing problems. Therefore, it is essential that all the feedback mechanisms are tested by people with cognitive disabilities. See the <a href="coga-designrequirements.html#theme8">design requirments for feedback.</a></p></li>
				</ol>
			</p>

		
				<p class="ednote">The task force is taking all the design requirements and turning them into easy to read checkpoints. They will be divided by themes listed above. Most of the design requirements were originally created as recommendations for WCAG, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/cognitive-a11y-tf/wiki/SC_To_Do_list">full list of potential requirements</a> is available, and you can also review the progress of the task force in making <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WcfVALVq8PS9CLXUuAfV9Op0wXvI2yJYedj5jO23GTk/">readable requirements geared to web developers</a>. The task force appreciates feedback on this work.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="user-group-mapping">
				<h2>Mapping requirements to user groups</h2>
				<p>The table of design requirements and user groups maps requirements such as &quot;User safety&quot; and &quot;Task completion&quot; with the groups of users who benefit, such as those with &quot;Memory impairments&quot; and &quot;Reduced focus and context&quot;.</p>
				<p>Please review the table at <a href="../content-usable/table.html">Table of design requirements and user groups</a> </p>

						<li>A policy for critical services might include any item with a high or medium level need</li>
						<li>A policy for emergency services might  include all items</li>
						<li>A policy for legislation for wide adoption for all web sites might  include any item that are testable, does not require human testing and have a high user need level.</li>
						<li>A policy for legislation for content needed in the workplace might  include any item that are testable, and have a high or medium level user need level.</li>
