		<section id="abstract">Coga Usable document prototype, according to Kevin's suggestions. Try to keep the structure of the documents in TR simple and easy to read, and point more content to the web page through links, just like the document structure of WCAG. At the same time, we can add more styles and designs to the web page. </section>

			<h1>Objectives</h1>
			
			<p>The following content is simplified based on the document structure of coga-usable v1. Try to keep the structure of the documents in TR simple and easy to read, and move the patterns and user stores to the website. The structure is similar to WCAG.</p>
		<section>
			<h2>
				Objective 1: Help Users Understand What Things are and How to Use Them
			</h2>
			<div class="doclinks"><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2/supplemental/objectives/o1-understandable/#description">Understanding this objective</a> <span class="screenreader">|</span> <br><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2/supplemental/objectives/o1-understandable/#designpatternsforthisobjective">Design Patterns for this Objective</a> <span class="screenreader">|</span> <br><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2/supplemental/objectives/o1-understandable/#userstoriesandpersonas">User Stories and Personas</a></div>
			<p>Use icons, symbols, terms, and design patterns that are already familiar to users so that they do not have to learn new ones. People with cognitive and learning disabilities often need common behavior and design patterns. For example, use the standard convention for hyperlinks (underlined and blue for unvisited; purple for visited).</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>
				Objective 2: Help users find what they need.
			</h2>
			<div class="doclinks"><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2/supplemental/objectives/o1-understandable/#description">Understanding this objective</a> <span class="screenreader">|</span> <br><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2/supplemental/objectives/o1-understandable/#designpatternsforthisobjective">Design Patterns for this Objective</a> <span class="screenreader">|</span> <br><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2/supplemental/objectives/o1-understandable/#userstoriesandpersonas">User Stories and Personas</a></div>
			<p>Make navigating the system easy. Use a clear and easy-to-follow layout with visual cues, such as icons. Clear headings, boundaries, and regions also helps people understand the page design.

			</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>
				Objective 3: Use clear content (text, images and media).
			</h2>
			<div class="doclinks"><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2/supplemental/objectives/o1-understandable/#description">Understanding this objective</a> <span class="screenreader">|</span> <br><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2/supplemental/objectives/o1-understandable/#designpatternsforthisobjective">Design Patterns for this Objective</a> <span class="screenreader">|</span> <br><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2/supplemental/objectives/o1-understandable/#userstoriesandpersonas">User Stories and Personas</a></div>
			<p>A good design makes errors less likely. Ask the user only for what you need! When errors occur, make it easy for the user to correct them.
