		        <h3>Expected Results</h3>
		        <ul> <li> All checks above are true </li> </ul>
		        <h2>Techniques</h2>
		        <ol>
		          <li> Making the help content reachable with one user action.</li>
		          <li> Making the human help reachable within two user interaction. </li>
