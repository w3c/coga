		        <h2><a id="user-content-description" href="https://github.com/w3c/wcag21/wiki/Proposals-for-new-Success-Criteria#description" aria-hidden="true"></a>Description</h2>
                  <p>The use of timed events can present significant barriers for users with cognitive disabilites as these users may require more time to read content or to perform functions such as filling out an online form. For situations where the absence of a timed event would significantly change the intended functionality of an application (for example, for an auction or other real-time event) it is important to ensure that users with disabilities are properly notified of timed events along with an indication of the duration of the time given as well mechanisms which are clearly labeled to adjust, extend or stop the time duration of such an event in order to allow them to fully engage and interact with the Web content and functionality. For example, if the checkout process in an an e-commerce website is automatically disabled to provide secure credit card transations, the user is notified of the timeout and is given at least 120 seconds for the ability to extend the time. </p>
		        <h2><a id="user-content-benefits" href="https://github.com/w3c/wcag21/wiki/Proposals-for-new-Success-Criteria#benefits" aria-hidden="true"></a>Benefits</h2>
		        <p>This Success Criterion helps users who need additional time performing tasks or reading content. This can include:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>The checkout process in an an e-commerce website</li>
                    <li>Registering for an online or in-person event through a Website</li>
                    <li>A registration process required for joining a member based Website</li>
                    <li>Reading study materials for an online class or test</li>
                  </ul>
                <p>This helps people with many different cognitive disabilities including people with: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Language related disabilities </li>
              <li>Memory related disabilities </li>
              <li>Focus and attention related disabilities </li>
              <li>Disabilities that effects executive function and decision making </li>
