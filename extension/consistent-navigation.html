<h1>Consistent Navigation</h1>
<h2>SC Text</h2>
<p><strong>Current:</strong><br>
3.2.3 Consistent Navigation: Navigational mechanisms that are repeated   on multiple Web pages within a set of Web pages occur in the same   relative order each time they are repeated, unless a change is initiated   by the user. (Level AA)</p>
<p><br>
  <strong>Proposed:</strong></p>
<p>3.2.3 Consistent Navigation: Navigational mechanisms that are   repeated on multiple Web pages within a set of Web pages occur in the   same relative order each time they are repeated, unless a change is   initiated by the user. @@Common  navigation, search and   control elements are have a consistent  position within a set of web   pages in the primary modality of the content, <span id="docs-internal-guid-9beb1966-6804-c193-be68-b6ff65ee8ec7">unless a change is initiated by the user.</span>@@</p>
<p>Exception: If an inconsistent layout is an essential part of the main function of the site</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Suggestion for Priority Level (AA)</h2>
<p>AA</p>
<h2>Related Glossary additions or changes</h2>
<p>Define the primary modality of the content as modalities considored in the design of the content</p>
<h2>What Principle and Guideline the SC falls within.</h2>
<p>Principle 3, Guideline 3.2</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to  ensure consistent position of common  navigation, search and   control elements  that appear repeatedly within  a set of Web pages. For example  controls and menu items consistently positioned in across a site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Benefits</h2>
<p>  Many users with cognitive and learning disabilities rely heavily on their  familiarity with a web pages&rsquo; components. If identical functions are to be found in diffrent places on different Web pages, the site will be considerably more  difficult to use. It will also be confusing and increase the cognitive load for  people with cognitive disabilities, increasing mistakes, and limiting some users from accessing the  content. This supports those who have reading and some visual perceptual   difficulties due to Receptive Aphasia as well as   those with general cognitive learning disabilities. It also helps those   with visual acuity difficulties where stroke and age related   disabilities co-occur. Also,  users with memory impairments, will need to learn a lot more  to be able to use the site, making it impossible for some. Therefore, consistent  styles will increase the number of people who can use the site and will help many others.</p>

<h2>Testability</h2>
<p>Step 1. Ensure (by  inspection) all components including navigation components  and icons are positioned consistently<br>
</p>
<h2>Techniques</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Using css to consistent  position common  navigation, search and   control elements </li>
  <li> Using a template to consistent  position common  navigation, search and   control elements </li>
