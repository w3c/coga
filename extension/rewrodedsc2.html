<p><strong>Information is provided in manageable chunks, that include:  </strong> </p>
  <ol>
  <li>One idea per paragraph. (One sentence is enough for a paragraph.) </li>
  <li>Have one point per sentence. Long sentences can often be broken up into short sentences or lists. If a sentence can use more than two clauses, it typically can be broken up.</li>
  <li>Lists are used appropriately (COGA Techniques 2.1.1) 
  </li>
  </ol>
  <p>For audio or visual media </p>
  <p>Media that is over five minuets is divided into programmatically determinable  and logical sections. Each section must be navigable to and provided with a unique label that describes the section. (removed For multi media, the user can directly navigate to each  section of the content. )</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h4><strong>ADD to 3.2.4 </strong></h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Consistent styles are used for the <a>same type of information</a> and control (COGA Techniques 2.1.1). (see COGA Techniques 2.4) </li>
    <li>(removed - 
      Provide a consistent design within a set of pages that includes:
      <ul>
        <li>A consistent layout of common elements such as navigational elements, search and controls</li>
        <li>Consistent use of icons and controls such that the same icons and buttons serve the same function. Interactive controls with the same role are consistently presented across a set of web pages </li>
      </ul>
      )
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>The main purpose of each page and section of content is <em>obvious </em>. </strong> Extraneous information that is not relevant to the  main purpose of each page is separated in the modality of the user and pragmatically determinable.

  </p>
<p>(Techniques Headings  are provided that describe the topic or purpose of each section and are <em>easy to find</em>. </p>
<p>also see COGA2.1.2) and wcag </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Provide a clear and understandable layout  that includes:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Structure and relationships are  obvious such that over 95% of users can immediately identity the structure and relationships (COGA Techniques 2.1.1) </li>
    <li>Paragraphs are clearly separated  (white space in text or by a pause in speech content)</li>
    <li> Check use of appropriate punctuation between numbers when providing times as these may be read inappropriately by text to speech engines. (Example time)</li>
    <li>Provide a clear font or voice. A clear font or voice is one that is:
      <ul>
        <li>backed up by user research where coga users are part of the user testing or, </li>
        <li>identified in a known WCAG technique or, </li>

  <h4>Interactive controls are visually clear or visually clear controls are <a>easily available</a> that conform to the following:</h4>

  <ol>
    <li>Interactive controls are perceivable in the modality of the user</li>
    <li>Interactive controls including links are visually discriminable and their boundaries are  clear in the modality of the user. Boundaries on interactive controls and boundaries of icons should have a sufficient color contrast of 1.5 (visual only). 
    </li>
    <li>The qualities or properties of the control define its possible uses. It is clear how it can or should be used and what action it will trigger. Actions and actionable items that can be interacted with should have a clear visual style that indicates how to interact with them e.g. buttons that look like buttons. Visually clear controls can be made easily available though easy to use personalization (when available) </li>
  </ol>
  <div class="technique">
    <p>Techniques include: additional controls are under a sub menu item such as a button that reads "show toolbar" Technique will include: </p>
    <ol>
      <li> Using techniques like 'flat design' with great care as they have reduced affordances. </li>
