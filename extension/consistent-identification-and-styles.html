<h1>Consistent Identification @@ and <strong>Styles</strong></h1>
<h2>SC Text</h2>
<p><strong>Current:</strong><br>
  3.2.4 Consistent Identification:  Components that have the same functionality within a set of Web pages are  identified consistently. (Level AA) <br>
  <strong>Proposed:</strong></p>
<p><br>
  <strong>Consistent Identification @@and Styles@@: </strong>Components that have the same functionality within a set of Web pages  are identified consistently. @@Components that have the same type of  information or have the same function within a set of Web pages are styled  consistently in the primary modality of the content. <br>
  Exception: If a specific structure is an essential part of the main  function of the Web page. @@ (Level AA)</p>
<h2>Suggestion for Priority Level (AA)</h2>
<p>AA</p>
<h2>Related Glossary additions or changes</h2>
<p><em>Styled consistently</em>  usage of the  same font or voice, font colors and  background  colors , shape, font style, images and special effects ­­­­(and position in  the same location relative to other reoccurring components and  regions in the content)<br>
[<em>Same type of information </em>includes information with the same role function or concept such as ARIA role, element name or COGA concept, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>define the primary modality of the content as modalities considored in the design of the content</p>
<h2>What Principle and Guideline the SC falls within.</h2>
<p>Principle 3, Guideline 3.2</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to  ensure consistent styles of functional components that appear repeatedly within  a set of Web pages. The intent is to be  consistent within a single web page, and  within a set of web pages where something is repeated on more than one page in  the set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>All headings with the same role have the same style,</li>
  <li>appearance of controls and menu items consistent in all areas,</li>
  <li>icons, controls and menus are used consistently across a site.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Benefits</h2>
<p>  The more predictable your content is the easier it is to know how to use it. Many users with cognitive and learning disabilities rely heavily on their  familiarity with a web pages&rsquo; components. They may learn a specific interface. If identical functions are in a differently on different Web pages, the site will be considerably more  difficult to use. It will also be confusing and increase the cognitive load for  people with cognitive disabilities, limiting some users from accessing the  content. This supports those who have reading and some visual perceptual   difficulties due to Receptive Aphasia and acquired dyslexia as well as   those with general cognitive learning disabilities. It also helps those   with visual acuity difficulties where stroke and age related   disabilities co-occur. Also,  users with memory impairments, will need to learn a lot more  to be able to use the site, making it impossible for some. Therefore, consistent  styles will increase the number of people who can use the site and will help many others.</p>

<h2>Testability</h2>
<p><strong>General test</strong> <br>
  For HTML and Web  Content<br>
  </p>
<p>Step 1. Ensure (by  inspection) all components including navigation components links and icons are  identified and styled consistently<br>
  Step 2. Ensure all  controls that have the same function are styled consistently</p>
<p><span dir="LTR"> </span>Step 3: All headings with the  same level and  role have the same style,</p>
<h2>Techniques</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Using css to style all items with the same role (such as examples) with the same style</li>
  <li> Using css to style items of the same role and class consistently</li>
</ul>
