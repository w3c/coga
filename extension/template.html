		<title>Add SC Shortname</title>
		
	</head>

<body>
		
<h2>SC Shortname</h2>
		        <p>This is the short name for the SC (e.g. "Non-text Content" is the short name for SC 1.1.1 in WCAG 2.0)</p>
		        <p>&nbsp;</p>
		        <p>Please try anfd keep formating basic - no block quotes etc</p>
		        <h2>SC Text</h2>
		        <p><strong>Summary sentence:</strong> (optional)</p>
		        <p>This is the text of the Success Criterion. Take the original wording from : <a href="https://rawgit.com/w3c/coga/master/extension/index.html">coga for wcag</a>. Remember to include any exceptions! </p>
		        <p>The wording needs to be</p>
		        <ul>
		          <li> testable</li>
		          <li> clear </li>
		          <li>applicable to all content</li>
	            </ul>
		        <p>See <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wiki/WCAG_2.1_Success_Criteria">WCAG_2.1_Success_Criteria </a></p>
		        <p>If it is not clear then do not do the testable section yet. Bring it to the lists attentions - We will need to reword it together. </p>
		        <p>If the current wording is unclear you can rework, but put the original wording in brackets after so it is easy for the task force and working group to compare. </p>
		        <p>You can make it applicable to all content by adding an exception.</p>
		        <p>If suggesting a wording change to an existing success criteria, write the complete SC text and then follow that with a version which indicates the changes by surrounding new text with "@@". For example (just an example):</p>
		        <h3>Current: </h3>
		        <p>(only use if this proposal replaces an existing SC)</p>
		        <p>1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum): The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for the following: (Level AA)</p>
		        <h3>Proposed:</h3>
		        <p>(only use if this proposal replaces an existing SC)</p>
		        <p>1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum): The visual presentation of @@text, images of text, and icons@@ has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for the following: (Level @@A@@).</p>
		        <h2>Suggestion for Priority Level (A/AA/AAA)</h2>
		        <h2>Related Glossary additions or changes</h2>
		        <p>Details of any suggested glossary definitions or changes. you can find most of these at <a href="file:///C:/Users/lseeman/Documents/coga/extension/index.html#terms"> Terms</a> (in our original proposal ) or inline in the original proposal.</p>
		        <p>You may need to add a definition. If you add a definition please also add it to <a href="file:///C:/Users/lseeman/Documents/coga/extension/index.html#terms"> Terms</a> or send it to the list and I will add it.</p>
		        <p>Also David suggested  <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wiki/Proposed_wording_for_COGA_SC_on_visually_clear_interactive_controls">specific language for the SC about "interactive controls"</a> which we can use</p>
		        <h2>What Principle and Guideline the SC falls within.</h2>
		        <p>A simple answer, such as "Principle 1, Guideline 1.4".<br>
		          If proposing a new Guideline, indicate the Principle.</p>
		        <p>In our current proposal  <a href="https://rawgit.com/w3c/coga/master/extension/index.html">coga for wcag</a> , the SC is placed under a heading of what guideline it falls under. In this new template it goes here</p>
		        <p>you can look at WCAG 2.0 here: https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/</p>
		        <h2>Description</h2>
		        <p>A description of what the <strong>intent</strong> of the SC is, including what users benefit from the content successfully addressing it (examples are helpful, but not required).</p>
		        <p>This is our opportunity to explain why this Success Criteria is really important to real users and without it they can not use content</p>
		        <h2>Benefits</h2>
		        <p>We should make sure  the benefits section in each Success Cryteria (SC) clearly identifies cases of were people can not use content that does not conform to this SC.</p>
		        <p>Clear information about how the proposal will<strong> benefit users</strong>, along with<strong> justification</strong> and <strong>evidence</strong> of the benefits (this may be a link to a different resource). You can add examples about the user if it helps.</p>
		        <p>You can often find evidence in the bellow links, including the <a href="https://rawgit.com/w3c/coga/master/techniques/index.htm">COGA Techniques</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/coga/user-research.html">Background research document</a>. Feel free to add more!</p>

		        <h2>Testability</h2>
		        <p>Show how this SC can be tested. This may include manual, automated, or semi-automated mechanisms.</p>
		        <p>Manual - If you have ten educated people in the room, will they all agree that something conforms?</p>
		        <p>You may want to do the techniques first (see bellow), and then say how you can see if you conform to a success technique. This is a way of manualy testing conformance.</p>
		        <p>&nbsp;</p>
		        <h2>Techniques</h2>
		        <p>Possible technique titles which could be used to satisfy the SC (YOU ONLY NEED THE TITLE of each technique - not the whole thing). If existing techniques will fully satisfy the SC these can be identified here also. </p>
		        <p>Do a search for key terms in the <a href="https://rawgit.com/w3c/coga/master/techniques/index.htm">COGA Techniques</a> . Make sure you refrence any examples (pass and fail). </p>
		        <p>For example, a simple change to 1.4.3 (as in the above example), might result in a response like this:</p>
		        <ol>
		          <li>All existing techniques for 1.4.3</li>
		          <li>New technique: Providing sufficient contrast for icons</li>
	            </ol>
		        <p>References:</p>
		        <p>You will find a lot of techniques identified in our original proposal <a href="https://rawgit.com/w3c/coga/master/extension/index.html">coga for wcag</a></p>
