<h2>SC Shortname</h2>
		        <p><strong>Clear Text and Voice</strong></p>
		        <p>&nbsp;</p>
		        <h2>SC Text</h2>
		        <p><strong>clear text and voice:</strong> Provide clear typography (text and numbers), punctuation, and voice (speech) for readability and comprehension.</p>
<p>Exception: If a specific typography, punctuation, <span id="docs-internal-guid-9beb1966-67fa-fef5-ec21-6bee4438818e">content</span> (text or voice) is  essential.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h2>Suggestion for Priority Level (A/AA/AAA)</h2>
                <p>AA</p>
		        <h2>Related Glossary additions or changes</h2>
		        <p>Clear typography (font ), punctuation, or voice is one that is:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>backed up by user research where COGA users are part of the user testing; or</li>
                  <li>identified in a known WCAG technique; or</li>
                  <li>identified by user preferences (preferred); or</li>
                  <li>defined by an international standard.</li>
                </ul>
		        <h2>What Principle and Guideline the SC falls within</h2>
		        <p>We suggest a new guideline under Principle 3 &quot; <strong>Provide a clear structure and layout</strong>&quot;.</p>
		        <h2>Description and Benefits</h2>
		        <p>The intent of this SC is that users do not need to spend extra cognitive function deciphering letters, numbers, and words, and can focus on understanding the meaning of the content. When words are hard to read or discriminate, users with language-related disabilities will fully focus on identifying the letters, and on building the words. They then have to piece together the words to build the sentence. However, there is a limit to how many cognitive tasks a person can do at the same time. If so much energy is put into identifying the words, it is often not possible to also understand the meaning of a sentence. </p>
<p>This may be avoided by making the task of reading and identifying words easier, so that the user can focus on the meaning.</p>
		        <p>If identifying words takes too much of a user's focus, the content will not be understood, making it not usable.		        </p>
		        <p>&nbsp;</p>
		        <h3><span property="xhv:role" resource="xhv:heading">Layout for Numbers</span></h3>
		        <p>Check use of white space and punctuation; and characters between numbers. Use of spaces and commas within numbers can change how text-to-speech engines read it. This confuses <span id="docs-internal-guid-9beb1966-67fd-20ef-f6f0-9f2dd942d435">people with cognitive disabilities</span>.</p>
		        <h6 id="h-explanation-and-who-it-helps-19" resource="#h-explanation-and-who-it-helps-19">&nbsp;</h6>
		        Where any numbers are presented, their use needs to be considered. If they are representing dates, times, references, telephone numbers, or mathematical notation, their layout impacts on users' understanding. Users need not only to recognize standardized layouts, but also to understand the meaning as the numbers are read aloud by text-to-speech engines. This feature can provide those with dyscalculia, dyslexia, and attention deficit disorder, and those who may be under high-cognitive load or situationally disabled, with a better understanding of the concepts.
		        <h5 id="example-1">Example</h5>
		        <ul>
		          <li>Reference numbers compared to a quantity or a value, e.g., "Ref: 7241500", as opposed to "7,241,500 chickens".</li>
		          <li>Telephone numbers have localized layouts. Text-to-speech readers cope in different ways with the layout. Thus, a telephone symbol and/or a word for telephone/mobile/cell phone, alongside the number, can help avoid confusion.</li>
</ul>
		        <h4><span property="xhv:role" resource="xhv:heading"> Roman Numerals</span></h4>
		        Roman Numerals should be presented in upper case if used in isolation.
<p>Roman Numerals can be presented as lower case or upper case, especially when used with musical notation. However, these may not always be recognized by text-to-speech engines, or may be confused with other navigational elements, such as numerical bullet points. Use of Roman Numerals is not always easily understood. The use of this format for isolated numbers impacts on comprehension for those with dyscalculia, dyslexia, and attention deficit disorder, and should be avoided if possible.</p>
		        <h5 id="examples-5">Examples<span typeof="bookmark"><a href="#roman-numerals" aria-label="Permalink for Examples" title="Permalink for Examples" property="url"><span property="title" content="Examples">§</span></a></span></h5>
		        <p>Text-to-speech engines will try to read the lower case Roman Numeral as a word, e.g., "vi" instead of "VI" - read as /vie/ instead of six.</p>
		        <p><strong>Pass example: </strong>Roman Numerals presented in upper case if used in isolation.</p>
		        <p>Note that a blind person may also be dyslexic, or have a language disability.		        </p>

		        <h2>Techniques</h2>
<ul>
                  <li>Use a plain, evenly-spaced, sans-serif font, such as Arial or other  simple typography, with good spacing, appropriate kerning, and leading, to separate text and  darker-weight fonts. (List of good fonts.)</li>
                  <li>Use appropriate punctuation and spacing when representing numbers and times.</li>

                  <li>Take care to use bold text just for key items.</li>
				  <li>Avoide using <em>italics</em>, ALL CAPS, or underline for emphasis.</li>
                  <li>Make important information two font sizes bigger.</li>
                  <li>Numbers
                    <ul>
  <li>Reference numbers compared to a quantity or value, e.g., "Ref: 7241500" as opposed to "7,241,500 chickens".</li>
  <li>Telephone numbers have localized layouts. Text-to-speech readers cope in different ways with the layout. Thus, a telephone symbol and/or a word for telephone/mobile/cell phone, alongside the number, can help avoid confusion.</li>
  <li>Numbers representing specific concepts can be recognized by their layout, as well as being read aloud accurately by text-to-speech engines.</li>
  <li>Roman Numerals presented in upper case if used in isolation.</li>
                    </ul>

  <li>Using all capital letters inappropriately. </li>
  <li>Using non-standard font alternatives, such as "Cufo'n".</li>

  <li>Numbers fail to conform to recognized layouts, and are not read aloud accurately by text-to-speech engines.</li>
