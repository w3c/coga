<h2>SC Shortname</h2>
		        <p><strong>Consistent Cues</strong></p>
		        <h2>SC Text</h2>
		        <p> Provide Consistent Cues: 
	            Within a set of web pages, consistent cues are provided that identifies different content types and  the state of elements and regions that help the user understand its role or  state.</p>
<h2>Suggestion for Priority Level (A/AA/AAA)</h2>
<p>(AA)</p>
		        <h2>Related Glossary additions or changes</h2>
		        <p>Content types: The type and function of a content element. Content types are typically defined in HTML tag name, ARIA roles or personalization semantics. </p>
		        <p>Examples include: role, types of contact information, types of help,  types of functions, warnings, key points, errors, system messages, notes,  definitions, more information , table of content and site map, file types,  search, required information, errors, opinions,   essential information, types of transaction and types of reminder, usage  instructions and status of an element, invalid fields , non-native content and  sponsored content.</p>
<h2>What Principle and Guideline the SC falls within.</h2>
		        <p>Principle 3, Guideline 3.3 &ldquo;Input Assistance&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
		        <p>The use of inconsistent cues can present significant barriers to users  with cognitive accessibility needs. The intent of this Success Criterion is to  ensure that navigation, operability and the ability to complete tasks  associated with a website is fully supported by consistent cues throughout the  website.<br>
For example:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>A user with cognitive  accessibility needs may have difficulty understanding the state of a particular  control if the mechanism of displaying the state of a control is not consistent  throughout the website.</li>
                  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>If the content type and format required  by an input field is not clearly defined users with cognitive accessibility  needs may have difficulty determining the format of the information required.</li>
                </ul>
		        <h2>Benefits</h2>
		        <p>The benefit to users with cognitive accessibility needs is that consistent  cues and prompts provided throughout a website or application creates  familiarity and reduces cognitive load. The advantages of familiarity and  reduced cognitive load are that processes are easier to follow and appear to be  less complex. This may benefit users with cognitive accessibility needs in  several ways, including:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>If the user perceives the  activity to be too complex the user may decide to abandon the activity and  therefore be excluded from the information and / or services derived from the  completion of the activity. Familiarity and consistent cues will alleviate this  considerably.</li>
                  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>If the activity relies on the completion  of several tasks, then the likelihood of errors being made during the activity  increases, particularly for users with cognitive accessibility needs, if the  cues provided are inconsistent.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>While providing consistent cues is of benefit to all users it is of  particular benefit to a wide range of users with differing cognitive accessibility  needs including users with:</p>
<ul>
                  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>Language related disabilities.</li>
                  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>Memory related disabilities.</li>
                  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>Disabilities that effect  executive function and decision making.</li>
                  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>Focus and attention related  disabilities.</li>
                </ul>
<p>Providing consistent cues is a cornerstone of good UX design. It not only benefits users  with diverse cognitive accessibility needs but also benefits any user who is  unfamiliar with the material and as such the benefits are not restricted to a  relatively small subset of users<br>

		        <h2>Testability</h2>
		        <p><strong>Test Procedure</strong></p>
<ol>
                  <li><span dir="LTR"> </span>Ensure by inspection that headings and regions are identified consistently</li>
                  <li>Change state of elements such as tab panels and selected options. confirm that each cue is consistent with the other  cues within the set of web pages.</li>
                </ol>
		        <p><strong>Automatic tests can include:</strong></p>
		        <p>CSS toggles consistently on different states on similar items</p>
		        <p>CSS is used consistently on heading, roles, personalization semantics</p>
		        <p>&nbsp;</p>
