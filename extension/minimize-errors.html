		        <h2><a id="user-content-description" href="https://github.com/w3c/wcag21/wiki/Proposals-for-new-Success-Criteria#description" aria-hidden="true"></a>Description</h2>
                  <p>The intent of this Success Criteria is to minimize user generated errors by detecting, and when reilable and possible, automatically correcting common input errors.</p> 
                  <p>For example, while registering for an online banking account a form requires the input of the user's birthdate. The required input format is xx/xx/xxxx with a leading zero for single digits. If a single input field with no input correction is presented, a user with a cognitive disability may enter 1/3/1996 thus triggering an error notification. It may not be clear to the user that the required format is 01/03/1996 even if an example for instance, xx/xx/xxxx, is shown below the input field or in the error notification. To alleviate any confusion for the user the application should insert a leading zero if a single digit is entered into the month or day along with the required forwardslash characters which act as a delimeter between the month, day and year.</p>
                  <p>Minimizing user generated errors by automatically correcting them will also minimize error notifications. Error notifications may be distracting for some users with cognitive disabilites, taking focus away from tasks and task completion. Users with cognitive disabilites may find it difficult to understand how to correct an error even when a notification is given. In the case of an unsuccessful form submission, this group of users may abandon forms because they are unsure of how to correct the error even though they are aware that an error has occurred.</p>

<p>If automatic correction is reilable and possible it should be implemented. If automatic correction is not possible the content author, the user agent or supported APIs should provide a description of the error along with suggestions for fixing the error except when to do so would jeopardize the security or purpose of the content.</p>
                  
		        <h2><a id="user-content-benefits" href="https://github.com/w3c/wcag21/wiki/Proposals-for-new-Success-Criteria#benefits" aria-hidden="true"></a>Benefits</h2>
                <p>The task force has good evidence from usability studies which shows that people abandon tasks and believe they cannot complete tasks if they receive too many errors</p>
		        <p>This Success Criterion helps users who need help preventing errors. This can include:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Automatic correction of required formats for input fields</li>
                    <li>Appropriate default values for date fields within the context of the application</li>
                      <li>Appropriate default time zone format based on local</li>
                    <li>Appropriate default currency format based on local</li>
                      <li>Appropriate default temperature format based on local</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>We need to minimize errors because:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Correcting errors before they occur will minimize the number of actions needed to complete a task or process</li>
                        <li>Error notifications may be confusing for users with cognitive disabilities</li>
                        <li>Error notifications can distract a user from tasks and task completion</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>This Success Criterion helps people with many different cognitive disabilities including people with: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Language related disabilities </li>
              <li>Memory related disabilities </li>
              <li>Focus and attention related disabilities </li>
              <li>Disabilities that effects executive function and decision making </li>

		        <h2><a id="user-content-techniques" href="https://github.com/w3c/wcag21/wiki/Proposals-for-new-Success-Criteria#techniques" aria-hidden="true"></a>Techniques</h2>
                  <ul>
					<li>Accept as many formats as possible, such as different ways of writing a phone number and date formats</li>
					<li>Correct errors in the back-end, such as the post code being written in the text field with the city or state information</li>
				  <li>Calendars and dates</li>
                            <ul>
                              <li>Calendars should default to the first relevant day. Work calendars should default to first working day of a user's locale. </li>
                              <li>Calendar based booking systems must avoid ability to book return date before departure date. </li>

                            <ul>
                              <li>Use the default temperature format of locale. The requirement to convert between Centigrade and Fahrenheit and vice versa is burdensome so defaulting to the format of the locale removes one layer of complexity.</li>
