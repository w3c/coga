		        <h2><a id="user-content-description" href="https://github.com/w3c/wcag21/wiki/Proposals-for-new-Success-Criteria#description" aria-hidden="true"></a>Description</h2>
                  <p>The intent of this Success Criteria is to minimize the likelihood of a user generated error prior to an error taking place, thus minimizing instances of both errors and error notifications. Success Criterion 3.3.1 provides for notification of errors. However, persons with cognitive limitations may find it difficult to understand how to correct the errors. @@Additionaly such notifications maybe distracting for users with cognative disabilites, taking focus away from tasks and task completion@@. People with @@both cognative and@@visual disabilities may not be able to figure out exactly how to correct the error. In the case of an unsuccessful form submission, @@these groups of users@@ may abandon the form because they may be unsure of how to correct the error even though they are aware that it has occurred.</p>

<p>If automatic correction is reilable and possible it should be implemented. If automatic correction is not possible the content author, the user agent or supported APIs should provide a description of the error along with suggestions for fixing the error except when to do so would jeopardize the security or purpose of the content.</p>
                  <p>While registering for an online banking account a form requires the input of the user's birthdate. The required input format is xx/xx/xxxx with a leading zero for single digits. If a single input field with no input correction is presented a user with a cognitive disability may enter 1/3/1996 thus triggering an error notification. It may not be clear to the user that the required format is 01/03/1996 even if an example for instance, xx/xx/xxxx, is shown below the input field. To alleviate any confusion for the user the application should insert a leading zero if a single digit is entered into the month or day along with the required forwardslash characters which act as a delimeter between the month, day and year.</p>
		        <h2><a id="user-content-benefits" href="https://github.com/w3c/wcag21/wiki/Proposals-for-new-Success-Criteria#benefits" aria-hidden="true"></a>Benefits</h2>
		        <p>This Success Criterion helps users who need help preventing errors. This can include:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Automatic correction of required formats for input fields</li>
                    <li>Spelling and grammar checks
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>We need to minimize errors because:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Correcting errors before they occur will minimize the number of actions needed to complete a task or process</li>
                        <li>Error notifications may be confusing for users with cognitive disabilities</li>
                        <li>Error notifications can distract a user from tasks and task completion</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>This Success Criterion helps people with many different cognitive disabilities including people with: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Language related disabilities </li>
              <li>Memory related disabilities </li>

<h2>Working group notes</h2>
It was decided that the original COGA Success Criteria below should be broken into three separate Success Criteria - Minimize User Errors (outlined above), Labels or Instructions, and Identify Charges.
