		        <p>The intent of this success criteria is to support compatibility with assistive technology and standardized personalization. The definition of standardized API's are  identified in the native platform's documentation or in a WCAG technique. This is important as the success criteria is not open ended. </p>
		        <p>People with cognitive disabilities are often using add-ons as assistive technology. It is essential that add-ons and similar tools work. Otherwise we need to make the author support all the functions of the add ons in use as assistive technology.</p>
		        <p>This includes:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Support for standard for the Internet of things that allow for simplified and personalized interfaces such as ISO/IEC 24752 &ldquo;Universal Remote Console Framework&rdquo; standard</li>
                  <li>Standardized techniques to support interoperable symbol sets are used when available. </li>
                  <li>Allow reading of long form of acronyms</li>
                  <li>Support for  text to speech with synchronized highlighting of the phrase being read,  </li>
                  <li>Content simplification </li>
                  <li>Creating mind maps out of the heading structure</li>
                  <li> Support for retaining content that has already been entered and password management</li>
                  <li>Spell checking</li>
                </ul>

		        <h2><a id="user-content-benefits" href="https://github.com/w3c/wcag21/wiki/Proposals-for-new-Success-Criteria#benefits" aria-hidden="true"></a>Benefits</h2>
				<p>People with ADHD, Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia, traumatic brain injury, or weak executive function can experience memory impairments impacting their ability to remember details such as:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The IoT interface</li>
                  <li>their user name and password</li>
                  <li>what an acronym stands for</li>
                  <li>a phone number</li>
                  <li>the meaning of uncommon words</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Poor working memory (i.e. difficulty holding on to several pieces of information at the same time) may also be experienced by people with these types of disabilities.</p>
                <p>Providing access to simplified content and certain types of content like the long form of acronyms helps, and in some cases is necessary to allow, people with cognitive disabilities an opportunity to comprehend the content.</p>
				<p>Supporting password management tools enables people with memory related disabilities to successfully login and avoid being locked out of secure sites.</p>
				<p>Storing non-sensitive, user provided information provides the means for completing a task in manageable pieces rather than all at once. This is especially helpful for people with ADHD as well as other cognitive disabilities who may become distracted and logged out or fatigued while filling out a form.</p>
				<p>Suggesting common information like a person's phone number or address when encountering form fields requesting this type of information helps all people, especially those with cognitive disabilities avoid making mistakes. It also eliminates the need for accurately recalling this information from memory or to copy and paste it which is a task in and of itself that can prevent successful interaction with a form.</p>
				<p>When people with literacy impairments or autism are unable to understand or become overwhelmed by textual content, support for interoperable symbol sets can provide a way for the content to be comprehended.</p>
				<h3>The Internet of Things</h3>
				<p>Individuals with lower literacy may have different reading patterns   than high literacy readers when it comes to understanding displays for   &ldquo;smart objects&rdquo;; while high literacy readers scan text, low literacy   users may read the text &ldquo;word for word&rdquo;. This can creates a narrow field   of view which may causes them to miss objects and information   (essential for completing interaction with wifi for remote monitoring   successfully, for instance) not directly in the flow of text that they   are reading. </p>
                <p>Too many options may add to the complexity of interacting with   IoT devices. Additional options should be trivial to ignore and not   require a lot of reading to understand that they are additional, as well   as how to skip them </p>
                <p>Sometimes IoT interfaces may aims to confuse the user, such as a   default "reading" on a meter being set to "2" and not &ldquo;1&rdquo;. The user   would then need to reset it to &ldquo;1&rdquo;. </p>
                <p>It is important in any proposed solutions to make operational tasks   (interacting with the IoT) as transparent as possible in order that   users can focus their attentions on the functional aspects (relating to   content). The following solutions support general usability of the IoT   for everyone, in addition to assisting those with cognitive   disabilities. </p>
                <p>The task force discussed this paper on 0/03/2015 and felt that the following changes should be made to the content bellow: </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>We want interfaces either to support adaptability, be compatible   with supportive API's, or to provide an alternative simplified control.   We can not expect only standard controls to be used </li>
                  <li>A lot of his will be covered by the API's such as URC <a href="http://www.openurc.org/">http://www.openurc.org/</a></li>
                  <li>We need to review that the API's provide the support we need such as less features </li>
                  <li>We need to ensure web interfaces have the needed semantics - such as via ARIA and indiUI.
