			<p>This is a draft of additions for WCAG 2.0 to address the needs of users with cognitive and learning disabilities.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="sotd"></section>
		<h1>Cognitive and Learning Disabilities and WCAG</h1>
		<section>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>The following is for a first draft for adding  needs for   people with cognitive and learning disabilities into the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) [[WCAG20]]. It is based on the user research [[coga-user-research]]<a href="https://w3c.github.io/wcag/coga/user-research.html"></a> and the issue papers available at [[coga-issue-papers]]<a href="https://rawgit.com/w3c/coga/master/issue-papers/index.html"></a>. </p>
			<p>The supporting techniques  as well as information on who it helps and why, are described in more detail in the techniques document available from our <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/cognitive-a11y-tf/wiki/Main_Page">wiki</a>.  </p>
			<p>Detailed descriptions of users and the challenges, persona, and research sources are given in the user research document above This proposal for the WCAG  includes changes in the levels of WCAG 2.0 [[WCAG20]] success criteria, new success criteria and new supportive techniques. </p>
			<p>We have identified the following themes: </p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Help as many users as possible understand the site and know how to use it</strong>. This often involves using things that are clear and familiar to the user so that they do not have to learn new symbols, terms or design patterns. Personalization and good use of semantics can help make the symbols and design as familiar to the user as possible. </li>
				<li><strong>Prevent the user from making mistakes and make it easy to correct mistakes when they do occur.</strong> A good design and use of scripts will make errors less likely, but when they do occur the user should know how to correct them, without having to render other data or start from the beginning. </li>
				<li><strong>Help the user focus and restore context if attention is lost</strong>. Items like breadcrumbs can help orientate the user and help the user restore the context when it is lost. (Making breadcrumbs clickable can also help the user undo mistakes.) </li>
				<li><strong>Minimize the cognitive skills required to use the content</strong> and avoid barriers that stop people with cognitive disabilities from using content, such as hard to use security mechanisms. When possible, provide more accessible options. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>Note this is a first draft. We anticipate some additions such as techniques for multi-media. However most techniques can be applied to any media, such as dividing your content into sections and using a clear heading for each section. For multi-media it should be easy to go back to each section using techniques such as indexing and bookmarks. Also note that  references to the coga techniques  may change. </p>

              <dd>Spoken feedback is often more effective then written feedback. However having both spoken feedback and longer lasting written and visual feedback helps the user know where they are and restores the context if attention is lost.

	<h2>New success criteria</h2>
			<p class="ednote">We will be adding a simple language equivalent for this page when we have agreed on the content </p>
			<section>
				<p>We suggest adding the following as success criteria: </p><section>
				<h3>Under WCAG 1.3 - Create content that can be presented in different ways (for example simpler layout) without losing information or structure.</h3>
				<section>
					<h4 id="semantics">Use <a>semantics</a> and <a>safe standardized techniques</a> that enable the content to be adapted to the user scenario including <a>enabling additional support</a> and <a>personalization</a>.</h4>
						<div class="technique">Techniques include:
					<ul>
						<li>Use semantics and standardized techniques to provide extra help (COGA Techniques 4.1)</li>
						<li>Provide symbols on key content (COGA Techniques 4.2)</li>
						<li>Include features that support the user preferences</li>
						<li>Enable user agents to find the version of the content that best fits their needs</li>
					</ul></div>
					<p><a href="https://rawgit.com/w3c/coga/master/issue-papers/multi-modal.html">See also: Multi-Modal Content Delivery</a> (was:Semantics and standardized techniques that enable adaptivity are used when available) </p>
				</section>
				
			</section>
			
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Under WCAG 2.2 Provide users enough time to read and use content.</h3>
				<p>We suggest adding the following as success criteria: </p>
				<section>
					<h4 id="timed">Timed event are not used except for the situations listed below.</h4>
					<p>(See COGA Techniques 2.9.1 ) </p>
					<ol>
						<li>Sessions time out after 20 hours have elapsed </li>
						<li>Where security may be at risk a session can time out after half an hour of disuse. Where financial or <a>sensitive information</a> is at risk the time out can be shorter </li>
						<li>Timing is essential to the function of the content - such as some tests. </li>
					</ol>
					<p>Where there is an exception, the content must conform to WCAG 2.2.1 Timing Adjustable, so long as </p>
					<ol>
						<li>The function to turn off, adjust or extend the timing are controlled by simple action and labeled with simple text. </li>
						<li>A user or administrator settable time minimum must be provided to complete any controlling action. Note that all user setting must be easy to set and use <a>standardized techniques</a> when available.</li>
						<li>The user can be made aware of the time out limits, including the length of the warning - this condition may be deleted </li>
						<li>The user can easily return to the same point in a task, without data loss. <ol>
								<li>as the default </li>
								<li>standardized system setting (example the user can set that the data is not stored) </li>
								<li>option to set user preference that has a conformant interface and is directly available at each stage of the task. </li>
							</ol>
						</li>
					</ol>
						<p class="technique">Techniques include: Techniques with examples are needed such as a dialog on opening the app that seas do you want your old stuff </p>
					<p>(Compare to WCAG 2.2.1 Timing Adjustable: For each time limit that is set by the content, at least one of the following is true: (Level A) however the options is not useful for COGA- Extend: The user is warned before time expires and given at least 20 seconds to extend the time limit with a simple action (for example, "press the space bar"), and the user is allowed to extend the time limit at least ten times; etc. </p>
				</section>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Under WCAG 2.3</h3><section>
				<p>Guideline 2.3 "Do not design content in a way that is known to cause seizures" should be changed to: </p>
				<h4 id="23">Guideline 2.3 "Do not create mechanisms that are know to potentially harm the user." </h4>
				<p>Exclusion: Mechanisms that are know to potentially harm do not include selling products know to be harmful. </p>
				<p>We suggest adding the following as success criteria: </p></section>
				<section>
					<h4>Do not expose user information in a way that can be exploited without informed consent</h4>
					<p class="technique">Techniques to include: using functional requirements for personlzation that do not suggest that the majority of users are disabled. Failure technique to be added of identifying a user to a code that is used mainly for people with dyscalculia. </p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4 id="semantics">Do not add mechanisms that are likely to confuse the user in a way that may do them harm and use known techniques to keep the user safe.</h4>
					<p>Note that  this does not include selling products know to be harmful. </p>
					<p class="technique">Techniques to include: not adding automatically incrementing the number of items selected without warning the use . </p>
					<p class="technique">Techniques to include: Where leaving  the site or task is likely to cause harm, ensure that the user is aware of the  change and risks. For example, in a health care site when looking for one drug,  and an advert takes the user to by a different drug</p>

			<section>
    <h3>Under WCAG 3.1</h3>
				<section>
				  <h4 id="instructions">Instructions, labels, navigation and <a>important information</a> are provided with a clear writing style that includes:</h4>
					<p>(simple text version: Use a clear writing style) </p>
					<p>For all wording (other then exceptions): </p>
                    <ol>
                      <li> An easy to understand tense and voice. Please refer to the exemptions for changes for a defined scope such as a different location or language. </li>
                      <li> Use short clear sentences with a maximum of one conjunction and two commas. </li>
                      <li>Choose words that are in general use for the context. Use words or phrases that are used more frequently unless this will result in a loss of meaning. There is an exception if this is found in user tests to make the content harder to understand. </li>
                      <li> Avoid hyphenated words and acronyms unless they are the common form to refer to the concept. -<a href="http://www.fltr.ucl.ac.be/fltr/germ/etan/bibs/vocab/cup.html">http://www.fltr.ucl.ac.be/fltr/germ/etan/bibs/vocab/cup.html</a></li>
                      <li>Double negatives are not used </li>
                      <li> Reduce ambiguities by:
                        <ol>
                          <li> metaphors and <a>non-literal text</a> are not used or can be automatically replaced via an easy to set user setting and standardized technique. All meaning must be retained when <a>non-literal text</a> are replaced. </li>
                          <li> the meaning of each word is clear from the word's context, or programmatically determinable. </li>

                      </li>
                    </ol>
On controls, links and buttons use words that identify their function. Function can be
<ol>
  <li>The default term used for the function on the user platform or </li>
  <li>The function of the button or link (such as "search" in place of "go") or </li>
  <li>The destination of a link (such as "home" or "contact us") </li>
</ol>
In menus :
<ol>
  <li>The text of each main menu item is easy to understand. </li>
  <li>Each sub menu item is clearly associated with the main menu item under which it falls (This can be due being an industry or platform default) </li>
</ol>
<p>In instructions</p>
<ol>
  <li>Identifying each step in instructions, </li>

				        <li> Interactive communication systems, voice menu systems such as Voice XML automated customer service portals, which require the user to have a good working (transitory) memory.

				        <li> Hiding of critical features under categories that are hard to understand. Such as a Web Of Things interfaces, that requires the user to understand the word "mode" to get to easy to understand options. </li>
				        </ul>
				      <p>Exception: There is an exception when there is a not a known alternative that provides the same main function and does not rely on additional abilities. A known alternative can be a WCAG technique, W3C note, or in the documentation of the platform. </p>
				      <p><b>Technique examples </b>
				        </p>
				      <p><b>Examples in security:</b> Web security and privacy technologies, for example, intentionally require users to perceive more and to do more to complete tasks. Three examples of these technologies are passwords, CAPTCHA, and 2-Factor Authentication. Such techniques require that the user has a good working memory or short term memory required to copy a code or remember complex passwords. </p>
				      <p>Alternatives exists that can allow more people to use content securely. These alternatives include using Web tokens, signing in via email account or other account, or biometrics are all alternatives to the above. For more details on this issue and on alternatives are available <a href="https://rawgit.com/w3c/coga/master/issue-papers/privacy-security.html">https://rawgit.com/w3c/coga/master/issue-papers/privacy-security.html</a>
				        </p>
				      <p><b> In voice systems this may include,</b></p>
				      <ul>
				        <li>Requiring the user to understand categories,</li>
				        <li>Requiring the user to remember numbers</li>
				        
				        </ul>
				      <p>Can all be used as a barrier to getting human help. It is avoidable by having 0 as a reserved digit to access a human operator and by using best practices. For more details on this issue and on alternatives are available <a href="https://rawgit.com/w3c/coga/master/issue-papers/voice-menus.html">https://rawgit.com/w3c/coga/master/issue-papers/voice-menus.html</a>

				        </ul>
				      <p>This is avoidable by having simple text with symbols and clear discoverability of how o complete each task and recoverability from errors. Most user interfaces are designed to help users complete tasks. However, sometimes they can introduce barriers that are not necessary for using the content. When an author makes design choices that mean people who could have used their content now can not, that content is not accessible. </p>

								<li>Do not ask users to enter credit card details unless needed for a specific purchase.</li>
								<li>Allow pasting of password and payment details into form fields.

							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Format <ul>
								<li>Break up card input forms to match credit cards, e.g., 4x4 numbers.</li>
								<li>Different cards have different patterns of numbers eg Amex may have more numbers than Standard Cards. Payment forms usually ask the user for the type of card. The card input form should reflect the payment card type.</li>
								<li>includes: (COGA Techniques 2.9.3 )</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Calendars and dates <ul>
								<li>Calendars should default to the first relevant day. Work calendars should default to first working day of a user's locale. </li>
								<li>The user can not enter invalid dates. If the user tries to select an invalid date it must be clear why a date can not be selected such as with a short clear and friendly error message (for example "sorry that date has passed). This avoids abandonment of the process.</li>
								<li>Calendar based booking systems must avoid ability to book return date before departure date.</li>
								<li>Terms are used that describe the present past and future days rather than just using numbers or dates. By using terminology such as today, tomorrow or travel now in the appropriate language for the locale, the user has a clear understanding of the timeliness of the event, booking or occasion.</li>
								<li>Display long form of dates with punctuation, e.g., June 1st, 2015 or 1st June, 2015. This offers a clear understanding of the date. Punctuation helps the text to speech API read the date in a way that is easier to follow.</li>
								<li>When using numbers for time - check use of appropriate punctuation between numbers when providing times as these may be read inappropriately by text to speech engines.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Temperature <ul>
								<li>Use the default temperature format of the locale. The requirement to convert between Centigrade and Fahrenheit and vice versa is burdensome so defaulting to the format of the locale removes one layer of complexity.</li>
								<li>Allow reading of long form temperature. Reading the values long form rather than using figures is helpful in for the same reasons outlined in the dates and calendar section.</li>
								<li>Reinforce with non-numerical values, e.g., Very Cold, Cold, Cool, Mild, Warm, Hot, Very Hot. These are subjective values and may not always be helpful especially when dealing with weather and ambient temperature (due to reasons such as variances in regional average temperature - what is considered hot in UK is considered cool in India or Thailand). It may be possible to use look up tables and JSON to query relative average temperature based upon locale and adjust temperature ranges accordingly.</li>

			<p>1.3.1 Info and Relationships: Information, structure, and relationships conveyed through presentation can be programmatically determined or are available in text. (Level A) </p>
			<p>The following are <b>techniques under development</b>. We can not recommend their use until they have been proven to work reliably. </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Add technique to enable interoperable symbol mapping for products for Non verbal people. <p>In the Web Content: Syntax: aria-concept = "uri". Example (Pseudocode): <code>&lt;img aria-concept=http://wordnet.org/somepage#girlnode" scr="girlwithbow.gif" /&gt;</code></p>

			<h2 id="changedlevels">Items where WCAG 2.0 SC levels should be changed</h2>
			<p>We recommend the following level AAA are considered more important for COGA </p>
			<ul>
				<li>1.4.7 Low or No Background Audio No Background: The audio does not contain background sounds or Turn Off: The background sounds can be turned off. </li>
				<li>We would need to change it as well to - Turn Off: The background sounds can EASILY be turned off. </li>
				<li>1.4.8 Visual Presentation: For the visual presentation of blocks of text, a mechanism is available to achieve the following: (Level AAA) <ol>
						<li>Foreground and background colors can be selected by the user. </li>
						<li>Width is no more than 80 characters or glyphs (40 if CJK). </li>
						<li>Text is not justified (aligned to both the left and the right margins). </li>
						<li>Line spacing (leading) is at least space-and-a-half within paragraphs, and paragraph spacing is at least 1.5 times larger than the line spacing. </li>
						<li>Text can be resized without assistive technology up to 200 percent in a way that does not require the user to scroll horizontally to read a line of text on a full-screen window. </li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Note 2.4.8, 3.3.5, 2.2.3 No Timing and 2.2.5 Re-authenticating has been addressed above </li>
				<li>2.4.9 Link Purpose (Link Only): A mechanism is available to allow the purpose of each link to be identified from link text alone, except where the purpose of the link would be ambiguous to users in general. (Level AAA) <p>We would want to lose the text "except where the purpose of the link would be ambiguous to users in general" </p>
				</li>
				<li>2.4.10 Section Headings: Section headings are used to organize the content. (Level AAA) Note 1: "Heading" is used in its general sense and includes titles and other ways to add a heading to different types of content. </li>

(Level AAA) </li>
				<li>Note that this may need exceptions but most exceptions would still require a summary at an easier reading level. </li>
				<li>3.2.5 Change on Request: Changes of context are initiated only by user request or a mechanism is available to turn off such changes. (Level AAA) </li>
				<li>3.3.6 Error Prevention (All): For Web pages that require the user to submit information, at least one of the following is true: (Level AAA) Reversible: Submissions are reversible. Checked: Data entered by the user is checked for input errors and the user is provided an opportunity to correct them.
