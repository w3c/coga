		       <p> The intent of this success criterion is to 

split information into manageable blocks to reduce cognitive load, and 

to aid working memory for all users.  It enables content to be presented 

in smaller cohesive sections focusing on one point.  Readable content 

has short paragraphs and sentences with a single focus; whilst time-

based and synchronized media have navigable short sections.</p>

href="https://github.com/w3c/wcag21/wiki/Proposals-for-new-

Success-Criteria#benefits" aria-hidden="true"></a>Benefits</h2>
		        <p>Chunking content, whether it is visual or 

auditory, supports those with working memory deficits, such as those 

with learning disabilities and brain injury. The breaking down of content 

into small sections, whether it is developed as audio or video output; 

mathematical symbols; or a paragraph of text; improves levels of 

comprehension. </p>

		        <p>Splitting information into manageable 

blocks assists:</p> 
				<ul>
		          <li>the increasing population who are over 

60 (20% in the Northern Hemisphere by 2030) and many people with 

cognitive impairments, including language and learning disabilities. 

More than half of people over 60 years old - including mild cognitive 

impairment and Age-Associate Memory Impairment 

(<em>AAMI</em>).		          </li>
		          <li>working memory and retention of 

content.  Research indicates that 50% of those surfing web pages 

spend less than 12 seconds on a page; and 17% between 2-4 

seconds.</li>
		          <li>those with reduced attention spans, and 

enables information to be understood more easily.   Research 

indicates that the average attention span in 2015 was 8.25 

seconds.</li>
	            </ul>
				<p>A real world example is 

someone with dyslexia working with a task force member. </p>
				<p> </p>
				<p>"If I am faced with a 

long paragraph with sub clauses, I will copy it out and put in line breaks 

where I find a new keyword or point.  If I chunk the text, it is easier to 

follow each concept. Otherwise, it is just a wash of words and I lose 

track of which part I am meant to be concentrating on. When there are 

no line breaks and I have to scroll across, I forget what is at the 

beginning of the line".   Adult with dyslexia.</p>
				<p>Note that reading takes 

full cognitive function for many people, making remembering what was 

written at the same time much harder.</p>

		</h2>
		        <p>Identify the relevant standard 

techniques. Ensure content conforms to those standards, where they 

can be used for testing that information is provided in manageable 

blocks.</p>
				<p>For text</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>A single point per paragraph</strong>: A 

paragraph should consist of one or more sentences that deal with a 

single point. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Possible test: Identify a key word or point or topic sentence(a sentence that expresses the main idea of the paragraph in which it occurs.) . Confirm that 

each sentence relates directly to that keyword, point  or topic sentence. (Keyword can 

be identified in the mark up with <abbr title="cognitive 

accessibility">COGA</abbr> semantics at a later stage.)</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Short sentences</strong>:   Sentences have a 

maximum of one conjunction and two commas. A sentence should 

consist of a single idea. Exception: Where <em>Usability 

Testing</em> has found a longer sentence to be clearer or easier to 

understand.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Possible test: This should be easy to test for, as one can 

count the numbers of conjunctions and commas. It is assumed that, by 

the time this success criterion becomes adopted, automated tools will 

identify nonconforming sentences for the author. (This is a travel 

algorithm using regular expressions.)</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Lists are used appropriately</strong>:   When 

there are three or more consecutive items that could be considered a 

list, a list is used.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Possible test: An algorithm could identify sentences with 

3 commas or colons (like this one....); keywords such as &quot;such 

as:&quot;, &quot;for the following reasons&quot;, or &quot;step 

1&quot;; sentences with bullet points (such as a, b, c); etc. </p>
                <p>For a paragraph with four or more sentences, it should be 

confirmed that there are not three or more list items. (The first 

sentence may be the context, and the next three may be list 

items.)</p>
                <p>Three or more consecutive paragraphs do not have to be 

checked as list items because they should be made up of separate 

points.</p>
                <p>&nbsp; </p>
                <p><strong>For audio or visual media</strong></p>
                

<p>Media are divided into programmatically determinable and logical 

sequences. 
Media segments should be:</p>
 <ul>
		          <li><strong>Six minutes or less</strong>: 

Media should be divided into segments that are 6 minutes or less in 

duration.</li>
				   

<li><strong>Programmatically determinable and logical</strong>: 

 Media should be presented in a programmatically determinable and 

logical order.</li>
				    

<li><strong>Navigable</strong>: Navigation to each segment and a 

unique descriptive label are provided for each media segment.</li>
				  </ul>
				<p>This is  testable by 

timing/identifing the gap between <strong>programmatically 

determinable and logical</strong>; and <strong>navigation to</strong> 

chunks that have <strong>unique descriptive labels</strong>. If a gap 

is over 6 minutes, it does not conform.</p>
				<p>Detemining how to 

ensure it is logical and navigatable to or unique and descriptive is 

described in other WCAG tests (will add if needed)</p>
