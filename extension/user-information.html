    <h2>What Principle and Guideline the SC falls within.</h2>
    <p>
        Suggested priciple is 2,<br>
    </p>
    <p>and we suggest changing guideline 2.3  from</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Do not design content in a way that is known to cause seizures.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>to</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Do not design content in a way that is known to harm users.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp; </p>
    <h2>Description and Benefits</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p dir="ltr">Don&rsquo;t store personal information that could be used to harm a user.</p>
    <br>
    <p dir="ltr">Examples: storing information, which suggests a user user has Dementia, may make a target for scams; or storing information, which suggests a user has an intellectual disability, may make a target for predators. </p>
    <p dir="ltr">A predatory company could send requests for money, saying &ldquo;you haven&rsquo;t made your donation&rdquo; despite the user having made one. </p>
    <br>
    <p dir="ltr">It is vital that users stay safe.</p>
    <p dir="ltr">Another consideration is that many users have weak executive functioning, and are thus less likely to identify risks correctly.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    The benefit of this SC is to keep users safe while online.
