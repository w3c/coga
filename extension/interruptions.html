		        <p>replace 2.2.4</p>
		        <p>Principle 2 Guideline 2</p>
		        <h2>Description</h2>
		        <p>The intent of this success criteria is that people with impaired attention and memory can complete a task. When users are interrupted they may forget what they are doing and abandon the task. This can happen even when the original task is extremely important. For example a user is  making a doctors appointment, but interruptions  course the user to forget what they were doing and the critical appointment is not made.</p>
		        <p>Where a site may generate interruptions and changes of content, the user must be able to easily turn them off to control them, such   that: </p>
		        <ol>
		          <li>Interruptions can be easily controlled and turned off </li>
		          <li>Secondary content (such as special offers or complementary material) can be easily identified, controlled and turned off. </li>
		          <li>No sudden changes occur on the site. </li>
		          <li>Media events can be easily controlled and turned off. </li>
		          <li>Chat can be easily turned off and on again. </li>
		          <li>Non-critical messages can easily be turned off and on again </li>
		          <li>Where a standard techniques exists for the above it should be used. </li>
   				  <li>Further pop-ups and similar distractions must be always   consistently easy to close and avoid so that all people can continue   their task.

                    <p resource="#explanation-and-who-it-helps-27">It is worth noting that the taskfource is proposing semantics to support an integrated  solution. This is a proposal to help people stay focused and productive. It   is based on a matrix for distractions at the operating system , browser   or cloud level. Currently people can turn off  distractions such as   Skype, and Facebook, across different devices, and then may forget to   turn them back on. This idea manages all distractions by forming a cross   application and cross device distraction matrix that manages all   distractions in one setting. People and users can be clustered in terms   of importance or groups. For example, the CEO and your child's care   giver could both be considered critical contacts. So even if they do not   feel the message is urgent they can sometimes disrupt the user anyway.   Some family members and important colleagues can be in another group,   friends and extended family in a third group, system messages from the   compliance system can be a different group again. </p>
                    <p>Dimensions in the matrix can include: Groups of contacts, how   urgent the contact feels any message is, and the level of interruptions   the user can tolerate at any given time or setting. The user can set how   to handle any combination of the above for the level of concentration   needed at the time. For example, during normal work hours, messages from   important colleagues could interrupt the user, but any other messages   would get logged and read when the user has time. In another example the   user may be  giving a talk and sets the interruption level to critical.   Then, only critical messages from key colleagues and family can   interrupt. IE: Messages that a critical contact feels is critical and   urgent. Default systems can include setting work hours. Optionally,   distractions such as news websites could also be limited in low   distraction times. </p>
                    <p>Further pop-ups and similar distractions must be always   consistently easy to close and avoid so that all people can continue   their task.</p>

		        <h2>Benefits</h2>
		        <p>Distractions can cause people with cognitive disabilities to lose   focus on the current action being performed or draw attention away from   the primary content and can be difficult for some users to know how to   understand, avoid and/or stop them. Drawing the user's attention away from primary content can create a   range of issues depending on the user's impairment(s). If a user also has a low short term memory they may forget what task they are doing, and be unable to continue. If a user is   consuming content and their attention is drawn away this may impact   their ability to consume the primary content or complete an interaction   (process). If a user is carrying out a complete multi step action (such   as form filling) being distracted may cause the user to lose context,   thread or position in the action or sequence of actions. </p>
                <p>Once people have become distracted it can be difficult for them   to remember what they were doing. This is especially problematic for   people with both low attention and impaired memory such as people with   dementia.</p>
                <p>Attention is affected for most people with cognitive disabilities.   Including: dementia ADHA and others. Other people with disabilities may   find it hard to focus with a high arousal page with moving text and   animated images . </p>
