  <strong>What Principle and Guideline the SC falls within.</strong></p>
		        <p><br>
		          Principle 3, Guideline 3.3: Help users avoid and correct mistakes.</p>

  <strong>Description</strong></h2>
		        <p>It is hard to find a user interface design that is obvious to all users. Human help or beginner's help gives flexibility and support to people who are struggling with the interface.</p>
<p>Although providing extra help may be a burden, there are content providers who want to be as inclusive as possible. They may look to these guidelines for direction on how to include everyone. This may include educational sites or sites who truly believe that their content is important to everyone. It is therefore important to have an AAA criteria that provides this guidance. </p>
<p>Beginner's help is useful for people who are new to using the Internet, for people who learn slowly or have impaired short term memory and therefore do not remember terms and design.<br>
</p>
                <p>Help related content enables a user to conveniently access information needed to understand how to use a website effectively. Users who need help related content are usually already confused. </p>
                <p>Human help includes: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>An option for live help. Note: It must be easy and clear to close new windows that open as part of live help functionality. </li>
</ul>
                <ul>
                  <li>A phone number that will automatically call via an interoperable Voice over IP specification. </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                  <li>A simple site contact form. </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                  <li>Use available standards to get human help for example, using the 0 digit on voice menu systems. </li>
                </ul>
