  <h5 class="coga-5">What to Do</h5>
  
<ul>
<li>
Provide a friendly search to your app or website. Ideally, the search should include:
  <ul>
    <li>autocomplete,</li>
    <li>acceptance of close variants of search terms, such as singular or plural
    forms, acronyms, or similar terms,</li>
    <li>ability to easily find previous searches, and</li>
    <li>spell-checking.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
	
<li>
Support for finding the right result, such as: 
  <ul>
    <li>grouping of results with headings for each group when appropriate,</li>
    <li>ability to refine user's search queries using filters when appropriate,</li>
    <li>Boolean search operators and modifiers, when explained, 
	      can also help users find the information they need,</li>
    <li>ability to customize the number and presentation of links in search results.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
	
<li>
Reliable search, including:
  <ul>
    <li>make sure the search works reliably and finds results that match user's intent for common searches.</li>
      </ul>
</li>
	
</ul>

  <h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
  <p>
    Having a search capability allows users to find the content they need even
    if they cannot use the site menus. A user can learn how to use search and
    reuse that skill on many sites.
  </p>
  <p>
    Menu systems and most site navigation require the user to understand the
    menu categories. Users with impaired <a>executive function</a> may be unable
    to identify the correct categories.
  </p>
  <p>
    In some cases, users know the correct category via memory, rather than
    logic. For example, most users remember that the print function is often
    found under the file menu. Users with impaired memory may not be able to
    find these menu items based on recall.
  </p>
  <p>
    Help users find the right result they need. Users with impaired short-term memory, <a>age related forgetfulness</a>, or
    who are easily distracted may also find navigating a site and going to many
    pages to look for content difficult. If it takes too long they may lose
    focus and forget what they are looking for.
  </p>
  <p>
    Search is most useful when it corrects misspellings, finds appropriate or
    related content, and provides suggested auto-corrected versions of the
    search terms.Accepting close variants of search terms helps many people
    like those having language impairments, dyslexia, or a memory impairment.
  </p>
  <p>
    If there are many results from related topics, it helps if search results
    are presented under the appropriate heading and categories. This helps the
    user find the search results they are looking for.Advanced search options and filters 
    offer users greater control over search queries, making it easier to retrieve information.
    It is also specifically important for some people with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD),
    helping to reduce repetitive behaviors or the need to open and 
    check every result when most of them are not useful.
  </p>
<p>
   A busy page of search results containing long lists of links can also be overwhelming for people with 
   cognitive and learning disabilities and mental health challenges.Providing an easy customization 
   function that allows users to set the number of links and modify their presentation in search results
   makes it easier to recognize the correct search result and avoid becoming overwhelmed.  
</p>
<p>
  Ensure that search options function reliably, consistently, and as expected. This is key 
  to reducing anxiety and allowing successful information retrieval.Error and frustration can worsen 
  anxiety and depression. This in turn can affect cognitive functioning and thereby impact the 
  accessibility of web-based information.

  <h5 class="coga-5">More Details</h5>
  <p>
    Search is less important on small sites where every page is no more than two
    clicks away from the main page.
