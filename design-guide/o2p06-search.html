  <h5 class="coga-5">What to Do</h5>
  <p>Provide a friendly search capability. Ideally search should include:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Assistance to start a search, such as:
    <ul>
    <li>autocomplete,</li>
    <li>ability to easily find previous searches, and</li>
    <li>spell-check,</li>
    <li>allowing variations of search terms. For example: Caps or no caps, singular or plural forms, acronyms, or similar terms.</li>
    </ul>
   </li>
    <li>Support for finding useful results (findability), such as: 
     <ul>
      <li>grouping results when appropriate, with headings for each group,</li>
      <li>useful labels and descriptions for each result,</li>
      <li>filters to refine users’ search queries, when appropriate, </li>
      <li>Boolean search operators and modifiers, and explain how to use them, and</li>
      <li>ability to customize the number and presentation of links in search results.</li>
     </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Reliable search
      <ul>
        <li>Test the search function with real users. Make sure the search works reliably,
          and finds results that match user intent for common searches.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
  <p>
    Having a search capability allows users to find the content they need, even if
    they cannot use the site menus. Many users can not manage menu systems for a 
    variety of reasons. For example, menu systems and most site navigation require 
    the user to understand the menu categories. Some users may be unable to 
    identify the correct categories. However, many users learn how to use search and reuse 
    that skill on many sites.
  </p>
  <p>
   Search is most useful when it makes it easier for users to find what they are looking for.
   At the input level, this includes correcting misspellings or suggesting auto-corrected versions
   of the search terms. Accepting variations of search terms benefits many people, 
   including people with language impairments, dyslexia, or a memory impairment. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Allowing users to narrow their search prevents them from getting inundated with irrelevant results. 
    This is especially important for slow readers with impaired memory or users who get easily overwhelmed.
  </p>
  <p>
    The next step is helping users easily find useful results. Users with impaired short-term memory, <a>age related forgetfulness</a>,
    or who are easily distracted may find it difficult to navigate a site and look through many results. 
    If it takes too long, they may lose focus and forget what they are looking for.
    A busy page of search results containing long lists of links can also be overwhelming. 
    For example, people with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) sometimes feel a need to open and check every result,
    even when most of them are not useful.
  </p>
  <p>
    It helps if search results are presented under headings and categories. Advanced search options and
    search filters also offer users greater control over search queries, making it easier to find 
    the right information. Providing an easy customization function that allows users to 
    set the number of links and modify their presentation in search results makes it easier for 
    users to recognize the correct search result and avoid becoming overwhelmed. 
  </p>
  Finally, make sure that search options function reliably, consistently, and as expected. 
  <p>
  <p>
    Errors and frustration can worsen anxiety, which in turn reduces overall cognitive function. 
    This means that by the time the user finds the page or task they are looking for, 
    they are less likely to be able to complete it. Making the process of finding the right page
    easier will help them complete the task.

  <h5 class="coga-5">More Details</h5>
  <p>
    Search is less important on small sites where every page is no more than two
    clicks away from the main page.

  <h5 class="coga-5">Examples</h5>
  <p><span class="use"></span><strong>Use:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>Search that forgives or corrects spelling mistakes and allows similar terms such as acronyms or related terms. 
      For example: 
      <ul>
        <li>The user asks for information about “adhd” but uses lowercase. 
          Information about ADHD, ADD, AD(H)D, and attention-related disabilities were also included in the results. </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Search that helps the user narrow the results to the most useful. For example: 
      <ul>
        <li>A supermarket supports searching for chocolate by providing filters to reduce 
          the search results such as vegan, gluten-free, sugar-free, etc. </li>
        <li>The supermarket allows users to add Boolean terms, such as “chocolate and syrup.”
          The site makes it easy to find instructions on how to use these terms to narrow your search.</li>
            <li>Search results are presented under specific headings that make it easier to find the relevant results. </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Personalisation so that the users can customize the number and presentation of links in search results.</li>
    <li>Search that has successful user testing with people with learning and cognitive disabilities find it easy to find the correct content.
</li>
  </ol>
  <p><span class="avoid"></span><strong>Avoid:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>Search that overwhelms the user with results that are not what they are looking for. For example:
      <ul>
        <li>A search has lots of results but the user has no way to filter them.</li>
      </ul>
     </li>
    <li>Search that is not flexible and does not correct mistakes. For example: 
    <ul>
      <li>The search does not support similar terms or incorrect spelling </li>
    </ul>
     </li>
    <li>Search that does not have useful labels or descriptions for each search result.
    The user has to open the results to know if they are relevant. 
    </li>
  </ol>
