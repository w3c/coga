<pre class="yaml remove">
title: Help Users Understand What Things are and How to Use Them
summary: Use icons, symbols, terms, and design patterns that are already familiar
        to users so that they do not have to learn new ones. People with
        cognitive and learning disabilities often need common behavior and
        design patterns. For example, use the standard convention for hyperlinks
        (underlined and blue for unvisited; purple for visited).

<p>
  Users with <a>cognitive and learning disabilities</a> may have trouble with
  orientation and learning. This can mean people get disoriented in a site.
</p>
<p>
  Learning new things and remembering new information is especially difficult
  for people with <a>cognitive and learning disabilities</a>. They can also
  struggle or be unable to learn new design patterns. Make controls, icons and
  elements simple and conventional to help.
</p>
<p>
  Make it clear to users what things are and how to use them. This includes
  clearly indicating the purpose of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>a site,</li>
  <li>section of a site,</li>
  <li>page,</li>
  <li>section of a page, and</li>
  <li>controls.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Use headers, labels, and other signposts to help users know the purpose of the
  page, region, or control.
</p>
<p>Help users understand how to use controls and elements on each page.</p>
<p>
  Use familiar design patterns, terms, and icons to help users who struggle to
  remember new designs. Ensure the look, location, and interaction of controls
  and other elements are familiar and consistent across the site.
</p>
<p>
  Show a clear relationship between controls and the content they effect to help
  users understand the effect of possible actions and reduce potential
  confusion.
