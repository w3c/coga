  <h5 class="coga-5">User Need</h5>
  <p>I need to easily perceive the content, for example:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Text is clear because the background is plain.</li>
    <li>Media does not have distracting background noise.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5 class="coga-5">What to Do</h5>
  <p>
    Do not overlay words on busy backgrounds. Provide an option to remove
    background noise behind auditory content or ensure background sounds do not
    interfere with the main auditory content.
  </p>
  <p>For text:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use solid backgrounds for blocks of text.</li>
    <li>
      Use thick outlines with solid fills for text that is overlaid on
      background that has designs running through it.
    </li>
    <li>Use strong color contrast.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>For auditory content:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Avoid fast changing background content behind foreground auditory content
      (such as background conversations or unnecessary traffic noise).
    </li>
    <li>
      Provide an option to remove background noise behind auditory content.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
  <p>
    Reading a sentence phrase by phrase conveys more meaning than reading
    individual words. Phrases are also easier to comprehend. The more words an
    individual can process in one glance, the faster they can read, the easier
    they can understand what’s written, and the more they stay interested. Most
    people can take in a whole line of text, or more at once. Fixating on many
    words at a time is necessary for comprehension for many people. A slow
    reader may read a sentence slowly using 6 to 9 eye fixations, sometimes
    taking in only a single word (or part of a word) at a time. Adding
    backgrounds reduces the number of words readers can fixate on. Removing
    backgrounds helps users comprehend more words at the same time.
  </p>

  <p>
    Also, automatic word recognition is often used for reading comprehension.
    For example, approximately 200 words exist in the English language that do
    not fit traditional letter sound patterns. These words must be memorized and
    automatically recognized. If a user can’t recognize these words, the text is
    harder to understand. Backgrounds can increase the amount of time it takes
    users to recognize words.
  </p>
  <p>
    Similarly, background noise in an audio track can make it harder to process
    and understand the main content.
