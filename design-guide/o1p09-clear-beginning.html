  <h5 class="coga-5">What to Do</h5>
  <p>
    Make sure starting points of processes are:
  </p>
   <ul>
    <li>easy to get to,</li>
    <li>easy to orient,</li>
    <li>easy to find on each screen of the process. </li>
    </ul>
<p>
For example: Clearly indicate the first step of a process. Make the first step more visible and identifiable. 
  Use a predictable location, larger sizes, strong color contrast, and appealing icons to make the starting point stand out.
</p>
  <p>
  [Note:While making the first step easily identifiable, make sure that the current step should be the most visually prominent.]

  <h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
  <p>
    Sometimes users make mistakes and need to check their work. Other times users get lost and disoriented during a process. 
    The struggle to complete a process is often aggravated by stress, mental health and/or cognitive overload. 
    Allowing users to return directly to the beginning means they can check their work and orient themselves or restart  if they become disoriented or lost. 
</p>
<p>
Making strating step more visible and recognizable provides a more efficient way for people with cognitive disabilities 
to reorient themselves to complete their intended tasks.
