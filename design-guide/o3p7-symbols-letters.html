  <blockquote>
    <p>
      I need words to include accents, characters, and diacritics that are
      necessary to phonetically read the words. This is often needed for speech
      synthesis and phonetic readers in languages like Arabic and Hebrew.

  <h5 class="coga-5">What to Do</h5>
  <p>
    Include vowels, letters, or diacritic marks that users need to decipher
    words correctly. This is often needed in languages like Arabic and Hebrew.
  </p>
</section>
<section>
  <h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
  <p>
    Some languages, such as Hebrew and Arabic, have optional vowels and
    diacritic marks. Without these marks, most words with the same characters
    have between two (Hebrew) and seven (Arabic) different ways of being
    pronounced with different meanings. Most readers can read the word based on
    the context, and use their visual memory to guess the correct pronunciation.
    People with impaired visual memory, slow readers, and text-to-speech may
    often guess the incorrect term or pronunciation.
  </p>

  <p>
    For example, a user with a language disability is trying to sound out a
    word. They guess three different pronunciations until they find one that
    makes sense. Unfortunately, many people with language impairments cannot
    work out the meaning as words out of context may only provide an idea rather
    than a specific meaning. Text-to-speech often requires these characters to
    speak the correct word.
  </p>

  <p>
    Note that not all diacritic marks are necessary to pronounce the word
    correctly. Only letters and diacritic marks that are necessary for the
    unambiguous pronunciation need to be included.

  <p>Words can be deciphered and pronounced to have the correct meaning.</p>

  <h5 class="coga-5">Getting Started</h5>
  <p>
    In Hebrew add additional Yud (י) and Vav (ו) that enables correct
    pronunciation.

  <h5 class="coga-5">Examples</h5>
  <p>
    <strong><span class="use"></span>Use:</strong>
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Additional letters or diatric marks that enable correct pronunciation. For
      example:

      <ul>
        <li>He says: <span dir="rtl" lang="he">אֹמַר /אומר</span> (Hebrew)</li>
        <li>He wrote: <span dir="rtl" lang="ar"> كَتَب</span> (Arabic)</li>
        <li>Books: <span dir="rtl" lang="ar">كُتُبْ</span> (Arabic)</li>
        <li>
          It was written: <span dir="rtl" lang="ar">كُتِبَ</span> (Arabic)
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p><span class="avoid"></span><strong>Avoid:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Words without needed letters or diatric marks so the user must guess the
      pronunciation based on memory and context. For example:
      <ul>
        <li><span dir="rtl" lang="he">אמר</span> (Hebrew)</li>
        <li><span dir="rtl" lang="ar">كتب</span> (Arabic)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
