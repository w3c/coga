        <p>
          Use punctuation and format for text, numbers, and symbols that reduce
          ambiguity and improve readability and comprehension.
        </p>

        <h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
        <p>
          For some readers, decoding words, numbers, and symbols does not happen
          automatically and can be demanding on working memory and
          <a>executive functions</a>. If they find content too demanding they
          are at risk of losing its meaning.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some users may use assistive technology or personalization tools to
          help understand content such as text-to-speech that reads aloud the
          content. However, sometimes the punctuation or format makes it more
          likely that the screen reader will read it incorrectly. For example,
          Roman numerals may be read as text.
        </p>
        <p>
          A user with a learning disability may be unable to manipulate letters,
          numbers, and words to correct mistakes that occur because of
          formatting or punctuation errors. They also need to focus on
          understanding the meaning of the content in order to use it.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, a user with a communication disability may listen to
          content using text-to-speech. If the content is phrased correctly,
          they can understand it. Sometimes they hear content read incorrectly
          or skipped, particularly numbers and symbols, and they cannot
          understand it. If text, numbers or symbols are in an unfamiliar
          layout, the user may become confused.
        </p>
        <p>
          In contrast, a blind person listening to the content, is likely to be
          able to figure out the correct meaning even when words are not
          pronounced correctly. However, the word manipulations necessary to
          work out the correct meaning are not achievable by someone with a
          communications or language impairment.

        <p>
          <strong>Use language tags. </strong>Language tags are the key means to
          achieve the goal of unambiguous text formatting. See HTML [[HTML]]
          language tags and
          <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47">BCP 47 Language Codes</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Use punctuation correctly</strong> for the language you are
          writing in, as it will affect how the stress and intonation (known as
          prosody) patterns from the text are heard, when converted into speech.
          For example, in English, commas and semicolons will result in a short
          pause in the speech, whereas a hyphen - will generally be ignored.
          Question marks, exclamation marks, and speech marks can result in
          changes in intonation, such as a rise in the pitch of the voice.
        </p>

          in text were possible. These can confuse readers and are likely to be
          read incorrectly by text-to-speech tools. If these symbols are
          necessary then ensure they are marked up correctly, using techniques
          such as MathML and abbreviation expansions to provide additional
          support. Roman Numerals should be presented in upper case if used in
          isolation as they are likely to be read as individual letters.

          Long numbers may be read as single digits or phrased as a single
          number. This is a particular problem for phone numbers or zip codes.
          While it is difficult to control exactly how these numbers are read
          aloud, content creators can help by:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Displaying the content of the number and using HTML semantics to
            ensure users and assistive technologies are aware of the number’s
            purpose. In addition, the following recommendations can assist with
            improving text-to-speech rendering:
          </li>
          <li>
            For phone numbers, use the correct layout for the locality of the
            phone number and ensure users can select the whole phone number
            (including area code), so that text-to-speech voices can recognize
            the format and phrase it correctly.
          </li>
          <li>
            For Zip / Postal codes, include state or address information close
            to the number so that speech voices can expand known abbreviations
            (such as state names) and listeners can perceive the context.
          </li>
          <li>
            When writing long numbers, consider what separators will be familiar
            to your readers and how it will be read aloud. In general, English
            speaking countries will use commas between thousands and a period as
            the decimal separator whereas German and other European countries do
            the opposite. For example, 1,245 would represent one thousand two
            hundred and forty-five in English, but one point two four five in
            German. Text-to-speech output will assume the separators are being
            used in the format of the language of its voice. If this does not
            match the content, then listeners can become easily confused. While
            replacing thousand separators with a space has become a common
            convention to avoid confusion, it leads to difficulties with
            text-to-speech with long numbers being read out in a disjointed
            fashion. For example, 120 034 943 can be read as one hundred and
            twenty, zero three four, nine hundred and forty-three.

            <p>
              Consider how you write dates, because once again the
              text-to-speech will use the format associated with the language of
              the voice. A date such as 04/03/2019 will be read as “April 3rd
              2019” by a US English voice and “4th of March 2019” by a British
              English voice. Writing out the month in words can avoid confusion.
