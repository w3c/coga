  <h5 class="coga-5">What to Do</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Use common and clear words in all content. Look at the most common 1500
      words or phrases. These are the terms that people with severe language
      impairments are most likely to know.
    </li>
    <li>Remove unnecessary or vague words (such as: “and so forth”).</li>
    <li>Remove or explain uncommon acronyms, abbreviations, and jargon.</li>
    <li>
      Do not invent new words or give words new meanings in your application. Do
      not expect people to learn new meanings for words just to use your
      content. If you must create new terms, make sure the user has access to an
      explanation within one click or event.
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section>
  <h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
  <p>
    This benefits many people such as those with language impairments,
    processing difficulties, or a memory impairment. Using uncommon words can
    make text and media difficult to understand.
  </p>
  <p>
    People with language impairments often have a reduced vocabulary. Learning
    new terms is a very slow, difficult process. For other groups, such as
    people living with dementia, learning new terms is not realistic or
    possible. Using uncommon words, that they do not already know, will make the
    content incomprehensible (unable to be understood) and unusable.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, someone with mild dementia is trying to turn on an ICT heating
    and air conditioning unit. The menu item for selecting heat or air
    conditioning is labeled “mode”. The user cannot use the whole unit because
    of this one term. This type of design has caused emergencies such as
    hypothermia.
  </p>
  <p>
    Using common words and terms, with their most common meanings will help
    avoid these problems.

  <h5 class="coga-5">More Details</h5>
  <p>When using uncommon words, provide an explanation by:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>adding a simple language term in brackets next to it,</li>
    <li>providing a pop up definition, or</li>

    <li>
      using supported markup (see
      <a
        href="https://w3c.github.io/personalization-semantics/help/index.html#easylang-explanation"
        >easylang</a
      >). Note that

      is being introduced into the new personalization specifications
      [[personalization-semantics-help-1.0]]. At the time of publication more
      support is needed.

  <h5 class="coga-5">Getting Started</h5>
  <p>
    Start using clear words in headings, labels, navigational elements,
    instructions, and error messages. This will increase the usability without a
    large time commitment.

  <h5 class="coga-5">Examples</h5>
  <p><span class="use"></span><strong>Use:</strong></p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Common, clear, and easy to understand words and definitions of terms. For
      example:
      <p>Your landlord must follow the law.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Your landlord can only use your security deposit (promise money), for
          certain things, such as unpaid rent (rent that you owe) and to fix
          things that you damage.
        </li>
        <li>
          Your landlord must return your security deposit (promise money) to you
          by a clear date. This is usually 30 days after you leave the
          apartment.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <ol start="2">
    <li>
      Abbreviations that are explained the first time they are used, unless the
      abbreviation is more common than the full term. Abbreviations are in an
      abbreviation tag with a title after the first use.
    </li>
    <li>
      Acronyms that are not in common use, are explained the first time they are
      used, and are in an abbr tag (element) with a title after that.
    </li>
    <li>Jargon that is avoided or explained.</li>
  </ol>

  <p><span class="avoid"></span><strong>Avoid:</strong></p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Uncommon words without explanations. For example:
      <p>
        A Landlord’s Right to Deduct. When a tenant moves into a rental
        property, he or she will pay the landlord a security deposit. Depending
        on the jurisdiction, this deposit will be returned to the tenant within
        a specific time period at the cessation of the lease term, as long as
        the tenant follows all the terms and tenants of the lease agreement or
        contract. Select links below to read the laws that pertain to your
        situation.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <ol start="2">
    <li>
      Abbreviations, acronyms, and jargon that the user may not know and are not
      explained.
    </li>
  </ol>
