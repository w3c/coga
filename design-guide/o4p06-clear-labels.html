  <h5 class="coga-5">What to Do</h5>
  <p>Use clear labels. Labels should:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>use common words and <a>easy to understand language</a>,</li>
    <li>be visible and next to the relevant control, and</li>
    <li>
      be readable by assistive technologies, including those used by people with
      <a>cognitive and learning disabilities</a>.
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section>
  <h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
  <p>
    When labels are missing or unclear, users often do not know that the feature
    is available or what the control is. Although many users can guess what a
    control is for users with <a>cognitive and learning disabilities</a> with
    impaired memory or <a>executive function</a> are less likely to be able to
    remember the design pattern or work out what it is. A clear label that uses
    familiar terms and is located next to the control, helps people with
    <a>cognitive and learning disabilities</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Similarly, if a label is not next to a control it is confusing for some
    users. When a label cannot be next to a control, there should be clear
    visual indicators that visibly and unambiguously associate the label with
    the control. This will need user testing with users who have learning and
    <a>cognitive and learning disabilities</a> to ensure it is usable.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, a user living with <a>early stage dementia</a> is using an
    application. Some controls do not have visual labels. A caregiver shows them
    what the control is for and they can use the application. The next day they
    try to use it again, but cannot remember what the control is for. This
    application is not usable for them.
  </p>
  <p>
    In another example, the label disappears when the focus is removed. The user
    cannot remember what the control is and does not know how to make it
    reappear.
  </p>
  <p>
    Labels need to be visible, readable by assistive technology, and be nearby
    the labeled content.

  <h5 class="coga-5">More Details</h5>
  <p>
    Many people with <a>cognitive and learning disabilities</a> use web
    extensions and simple text-to-speech. These assistive technologies often do
    not read WAI-ARIA [[wai-aria-1.2]] or titles. Until that changes, or an
    extension displays them, labels should not rely on these attributes for
    people with <a>cognitive and learning disabilities</a>.

  <h5 class="coga-5">Examples</h5>
  <p><span class="use"></span><strong>Use:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Visible labels that use simple common words and are next to the control.
      For example:
      <ul>
        <li>first name ____________________</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p><span class="avoid"></span><strong>Avoid:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Hidden labels or labels that use uncommon words that are not easy to
      understand. It is unclear what action is needed. For example:
      <ul>
        <li>given name ___________________</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
