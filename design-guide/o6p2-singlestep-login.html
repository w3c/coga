  <h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
  <p>
    This pattern allows people with language and communication disabilities to
    login without being overwhelmed by blocks of text.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, someone with a severe language impairment using an
    <abbr title="Alternative and Augmentative Communication System"
      ><a>AAC</a></abbr
    >
    device wants to send a message to their doctor. They can press the login
    with the icon they know and send a message without having to read text.
