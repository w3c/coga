    <p>
      I need to understand my options and the tasks I can perform and I can
      identify the controls I can interact with to complete actions. (I find it
      hard to learn new interface design patterns.)

  <h5 class="coga-5">What to Do</h5>
  <p>Use common designs that are familiar to most users. This includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>design elements,</li>
    <li>affordances (visual hints about how to a control),</li>
    <li>patterns, and</li>
    <li>
      the layout and visual hierarchy (arrangement of elements to show the order
      of importance).
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section>
  <h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
  <p>
    Many users cannot easily learn and remember new design metaphors. Without
    these skills, it can be much harder or impossible to locate desired items
    with which to interact, and to know what interactions may do. Users can feel
    lost or overwhelmed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Users are more likely to find and recognize common design elements that are
    repeated often over a long period of use, across many sites.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, a user with a <a>mild cognitive impairment</a> or dementia,
    goes to a site to buy a product. They cannot find where to pay for the item
    that they want. They may think the site does not allow shopping and the site
    just provides information.

  <h5 class="coga-5">More Details</h5>
  <p>Common design elements, affordances, and patterns include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      A standard layout and visual hierarchy (arrangement of elements to show
      the order of importance). Place elements where the user is expecting them.
      For example, in an English site:
      <ul>
        <li>search in the top right hand corner in a web site,</li>
        <li>link to the home page in the top left hand corner,</li>
        <li>link to “contact us” in the top navigation area,</li>
        <li>link to the site map in the footer area, and</li>
        <li>submit button at the bottom of a form.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Common design patterns (repeated designs for controls and other elements),
      such as:
      <ul>
        <li>WAI-ARIA authoring best practices [[wai-aria-practices-1.2]],</li>
        <li>patterns used in the most popular sites,</li>
        <li>very common navigation design patterns and common icons,</li>
        <li>
          platform specific (operating system) user interface design for
          navigation mechanisms and icons, and
        </li>
        <li>
          adaptive user interface design that can be personalized (see above).
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      User interface (design) from a prior version. Allow users to revert back
      to a prior version of the application with which they are familiar.
    </li>
    <li>
      Links that look like links and buttons that look and act like buttons. For
      example:
      <ul>
        <li>underline links with a standard style throughout a page,</li>
        <li>links generally navigate to a new page, and</li>
        <li>buttons generally perform an action.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h5 class="coga-5">Getting Started</h5>

  <ol>
    <li>
      When designing web pages, select standard components that look and behave
      the way users expect. Use standard conventions for layout such as:
      <ul>
        <li>home link in the upper left corner,</li>
        <li>navigation at the top, and</li>
        <li>search in the upper right.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Create an obvious visual hierarchy in the page.</li>
  </ol>
