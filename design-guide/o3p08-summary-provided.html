  <h5 class="coga-5">What to Do</h5>
  <p>Provide a brief summary for a long document and media.</p>
  <p>
    Emphasize any important keywords to help people understand the purpose and
    content of the document, and determine if it might contain information they
    need.
  </p>
  <p>
    Summaries should use common words, short sentences, and be written in an
    easy to understand style and tense.
  </p>

  <h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
  <p>
    Providing an easy to understand summary helps many people to quickly decide
    if the content is relevant to them and their current goal. A high level
    outline in a few sentences or bullet points is most effective. Abstracts and
    executive summaries are usually much longer and more detailed as they are
    designed to summarize the entire document.
  </p>
  <p>
    For media, summaries help users with short attention span find the exact
    file they need and jump to correct content. All media files should have a
    summary description.
  </p>

<section>
  <h5 class="coga-5">More Details</h5>
  <p>
    Provide a text summary that can be understood by people with lower secondary
    education level reading ability.
  </p>
  <p>
    In pieces of content with less than 300 words, headings can act as a
    summary.
  </p>
  <p>
    Summaries of each segment should include the main points from the content.
    Users should be able to use the summary to uniquely identify the content and
    know what it will contain.

  <h5 class="coga-5">Examples</h5>
  <p><span class="use"></span><strong>Use:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Short summaries with bullet points that clearly state the main points.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p><span class="avoid"></span><strong>Avoid:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>Long texts, documents, or media without summaries.</li>
    <li>
      Unclear summaries. For example:
      <ul>
        <li>
          In multimedia, the segments are summarized as Chapter 1, part 1.
          Chapter 1, part 2, etc.
        </li>
      </ul>
