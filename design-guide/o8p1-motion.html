  <h5 class="coga-5">What to Do</h5>
  <p>
    Ensure that changes of context, functionality, settings, route, and
    orientation are initiated only by user request or an easily available
    mechanism is available to turn off such changes. Also provide an easily
    available mechanism to go to previous context, functionality, settings,
    route, and orientation.
  </p>

  <h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
  <p>
    Any content, settings, or functionality which changes unexpectedly, without
    user initiation can result in significant problems for users with
    <a>cognitive and learning disabilities</a>. Unexpected changes in any of
    these areas can result in loss of focus, anxiety, or confusion in
    understanding or using a user interface (such as menus, buttons, and design
    components). Examples include, but are not limited to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The automatic launching of new windows or pop-ups.</li>
    <li>
      Submission of forms through mechanisms other than a button that is clearly
      labeled (using simple language to submit the form).
    </li>
    <li>The opening of new content or a feature.</li>
    <li>Unexpected changes when selecting an option.</li>
    <li>Rerouting automatically by a Global Positioning System (GPS).</li>
    <li>
      Changing the direction of a map in a
      <abbr title="Global Positioning System">GPS</abbr>.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    For example, a user may not have a sense of direction or know their left and
    right. Before using a <abbr title="Global Positioning System">GPS</abbr>,
    they may study the route so that they know approximately what they are doing
    and can augment the directions of the
    <abbr title="Global Positioning System">GPS</abbr> with their own context,
    using the <abbr title="Global Positioning System">GPS</abbr> for cues. The
    <abbr title="Global Positioning System">GPS</abbr> automatically reroutes
    them because of a small traffic delay. They become completely lost and
    disoriented and can no longer use the application.
  </p>
  <p>
    In another example, a user is watching a video and wants to press “like”. As
    they are about to press the button, the controls shift and they load a
    different video instead of pressing “like”. They are now less likely to
    press “like” because they do not want to lose their content. As a result,
    their preferences are not taken into account.
  </p>
  <p>
    Letting users control when content changes gives users with
    <a>cognitive and learning disabilities</a> more control over how web sites
    and applications behave. This gives them the opportunity to make choices
    that enable them to use the content and complete the task.

  <h5 class="coga-5">More Details</h5>
  <p>
    Exception: The changes are part of an activity where it is essential (e.g. a
    game).
  </p>
  <p>
    Route: This is the directions and flow such as a
    <abbr title="Global Positioning System">GPS</abbr> route.
  </p>
  <p>Orientation: perspective or view such as map direction.</p>
  <p>
    Easily available (or easily available mode or setting), is when one or more
    of the following is true:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      It can be set one time with as a wide a scope as possible (such as using
      the standards of the Operating System (OS), From [[ISO 9241-112]] or
      [[GPII]] when available).
    </li>
    <li>
      It has the option to save or to change the setting for the scope of the
      set of web pages.
    </li>
    <li>
      It is reachable from each screen where it may be needed, and the path and
      the control conforms to all of this document.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h5 class="coga-5">Examples</h5>
  <p><span class="use"></span><strong>Use:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      User control when content changes. For example:
      <ul>
        <li>
          The user can set to change the route if more than a specific amount of
          time is saved. They can add more information such as how many extra
          turns are acceptable for saving 5 minutes. When the
          <abbr title="Global Positioning System">GPS</abbr> finds a new route
          that saves time, the
          <abbr title="Global Positioning System">GPS</abbr> tells the user
          about the change including how many extra turns were added and how
          much time will be saved. The
          <abbr title="Global Positioning System">GPS</abbr> asks the user if
          they want to change the route or if the
          <abbr title="Global Positioning System">GPS</abbr> changed it, the
          user can go back to the original route in one touch or command.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p><span class="avoid"></span><strong>Avoid:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>Content that changes without the user having control.</li>
  </ol>
