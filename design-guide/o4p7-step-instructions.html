  <h5 class="coga-5">What to Do</h5>
  <p>Write clear instructions that are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>located before, or next to, the field or activity,</li>
    <li>broken down by steps (ensure that steps are not omitted)</li>
    <li>clear, concise, and accessible, and</li>
    <li>
      available with examples or illustrations that make it easy to understand
      what to do.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
  <p>
    Clear instructions help prevent user errors. This reduces frustration and
    enhances users’ autonomy and independence because they can avoid asking for
    help. This helps many people with
    <a>cognitive and learning disabilities</a> as well as people from different
    cultures, emerging markets, and new users who may not be familiar with web
    forms or may miss cultural context.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, a person with <a>age-related forgetfulness</a> is trying to
    complete a form. They put the whole address and zip or postal code in one
    line (as one would do when writing a letter). They are given an error
    message. After a few error messages, they are exhausted and cannot complete
    the form.
  </p>
</section>
<section>
  <h5 class="coga-5">More Details</h5>
  <p>
    Provide instructions at the start of the process, not simply in an error
    message.
  </p>
  <p>
    Provide instructions needed to enable the user to complete the task. When
    multiple formats are accepted or errors are automatically corrected, less
    instructions are needed for the user to complete the task.
  </p>
  <p>Note that instructions can be hidden behind a familiar icon.</p>

  <h5 class="coga-5">Getting Started</h5>
  <p>
    In a system with common errors, tackle the most impactful errors first and
    add guidance as needed.
  </p>

  <h5 class="coga-5">Examples</h5>
  <p><span class="use"></span><strong>Use:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Clear and easy to understand instructions. For example:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Provide an image of a passport with the number highlighted to indicate
          the number that the user should enter.
        </li>
        <li>
          Explicitly say which day of the week is the start (e.g., Sunday or
          Monday) in calendar controls.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p><span class="avoid"></span><strong>Avoid:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      No clear instructions for complex tasks. For example:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Request a passport number, but do not indicate which of several
          numbers on the passport is needed.
        </li>
        <li>
          A site does not clarify the first day of the week and assumes the work
          week starts on Monday. A user from a different culture assumes the
          work week begins on Sunday, and makes a mistake.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
