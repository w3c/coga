  <h5 class="coga-5">What to Do</h5>
  <p>
    Make it easy for the user to ask for help or report issues at any point in a
    process. This includes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Easy to Use: Feedback information and forms are simple and clear. (User
      testing with different user groups is highly recommended.)
    </li>
    <li>
      Easy to Find: Available from any place where the user may get stuck.
    </li>
    <li>
      Using a preferred communication method such as a form, email, chat, or
      phone support.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The option to provide feedback should never require the user to manage
    complex menu systems such as <a>Interactive Voice Response</a> (IVR) with
    many different options.
  </p>

  <h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
  <p>
    Providing an easy way for users to give feedback will help people be able to
    share problems, ask for help, make suggestions, and give positive comments.
    If users cannot give feedback easily, problems will continue to exist
    without the site owner being aware of the problems. It is essential to allow
    users to provide feedback from any point in the process so that people do
    not get lost when trying to explain why they are stuck. Ideas for
    improvements and positive feedback will also be missed.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, a user with a cognitive and learning disability struggles to
    use an ecommerce site. They have an idea about how to make it much easier to
    use. They spend an hour trying to give the feedback and then they stop
    trying. The site continues to lose customers.
  </p>

<section>
  <h5 class="coga-5">More Details</h5>
  <p>Make sure the feedback option is:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>simple to use,</li>
    <li>available in all stages of the process,</li>
    <li>a process that responds helpfully to any feedback submitted,</li>
    <li>
      easy to complete and does not make the user provide unnecessary
      information, and
    </li>
    <li>not reliant on complex menu systems.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Providing multiple methods for gathering feedback is recommended. For
    example, on a web site, consider providing all 4 options for feedback
    including live chat, a phone number, a web form, and a feedback email
    address.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that chat bots may not be appropriate for this particular type of
    feedback other than to start the feedback process. These can be extremely
    frustrating if you cannot easily get to the area you are trying to reach.

  <h5 class="coga-5">Examples</h5>
  <p><span class="use"></span><strong>Use:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Simple feedback mechanisms that are available on each screen. For example:
      <ul>
        <li>
          A banking web site had a major accessibility problem that blocked some
          customers from paying their bills online. A feedback form was on the
          page where the customer got stuck. A customer was able to report the
          problem and a help desk employee reached out to help them complete
          their bill payment successfully. That help desk employee also reported
          the accessibility problem to the software team.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <ol start="2">
    <li>
      Multiple feedback mechanisms such as:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Web Chat or Web Call - An option to provide feedback using live chat
          or a video call. Note: The live chat or video call feature must be
          fully accessible. Web chat should not be a distraction and easy to
          close. Check usability with user testing.
        </li>
        <li>
          Phone - A feedback phone number, ideally with a feature to
          automatically call via <a>Voice user interfaces</a> (VUIs) . Make sure
          there are no complex voice menus.
        </li>
        <li>
          Web Form - A simple site contact form with no more than 3 required
          fields.
        </li>
        <li>
          Email - An email link using the “mailto [[mailto]]” protocol with
          prefilled “to” and “subject” fields. Note that this will not work on
          all platforms or all mail clients.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a>Interactive Voice Response</a> (IVR) - Provide an automatic option
          at the end of an IVR to give feedback by pressing a specific digit on
          the phone.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

    <li>A single way to give feedback that not everyone can use.</li>
