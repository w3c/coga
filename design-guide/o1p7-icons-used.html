  <h5 class="coga-5">What to Do</h5>
  <p>
    Add familiar icons, images, and symbols to important content such as
    controls and section headings. Each icon or symbol should convey a single
    meaning and be next to the content it relates to.
  </p>
</section>
<section>
  <h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
  <p>
    People who have language comprehension, learning, or reading difficulties
    may rely on symbols to understand content and navigate to content they need.
    Symbols also help people who struggle with language and attention to
    navigate content, including media.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, a person with aphasia, has the intellectual ability to
    understand concepts, but struggles with language. They may be dependent on
    the use of symbols to browse pages for information.
  </p>
  <p>
    It can also help the elderly population who can find cluttered pages with
    dense text hard to read on a screen. Clear symbols, icons, and images that
    act as signposts to the text content can be very helpful.
  </p>

  <h5 class="coga-5">More Details</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Use clear and unambiguous icons or symbols that are easy to see and
      enlarge.
    </li>
    <li>Be aware of cultural differences.</li>
    <li>
      In left-to-right languages, when adding a few icons or symbols to a page
      place the image to the left of the text.
    </li>
    <li>
      When adding multiple symbols to a paragraph or section of text, place the
      symbols above the text.
    </li>
    <li>
      Use personalization semantics such as [[personalization-semantics-1.0]] to
      help the user load familiar symbols.
    </li>
  </ul>
