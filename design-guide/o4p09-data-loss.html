      I need time to complete my work. I do not want a session to timeout while

  <h5 class="coga-5">What to do</h5>
  <p>Avoid timeouts and let the user save their work as they go.</p>
  <p>
    When this is not possible, tell the user when they start the process:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>any conditions that may cause a timeout (such as being inactive for ten minutes) and
      the amount of time available to complete the process,
</li>
    <li>the process for extending the time (if there is one), 
</li>
    <li>if the user will lose entered data if a timeout occurs, and</li>
   
    <li>give as much notice for timeouts as possible without compromising security and safety.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
  <p>
    Timed events can present significant barriers for users with
    <a>cognitive and learning disabilities</a>. These users may require more
    time to read content or to perform functions, such as completing an online
    form. They may need to read help information or look at notes.They may also need
    additional time to look up the information required to complete a transaction.
  </p>
 
  <p>
    For example, while making a purchase on an e-commerce web site, a user does
    not remember required information. This may be a date, a phone number, or a
    zip code that may seem easy to remember for users without a cognitive or
    learning disability. They need to look up this information, which takes them
    time away from the screen. Then they need to copy it carefully into the
    form.
  </p>
<p>Further, users’ cognitive skills may diminish as they get tired.  
  They may need a break, without losing their place in the process, and
  without losing data that has already been entered. Sometimes they need to stop
  the task for that day. When users know that their data won’t be lost, they
 can recover from mental fatigue and return to successfully complete the task.
</p>
  <p>
   For example, a user is completing an online process for reserving a hotel room and purchasing a plane ticket. 
   They become overwhelmed with the amount of instructions and data input required to complete the process. 
   The user cannot complete the process in one sitting, and takes a break. Their information and work done so far is lost.
  </p>
  <p>
    Users’ cognitive skills may diminish as they get tired. They then must stop
    the task for that day. When users know that their data won’t be lost, they
    can recover from mental fatigue and return to successfully complete the
    task.
  </p>
  <p>
    Mental health disabilities can also cause cognitive challenges,  such as memory problems, trouble staying focused,
    and difficulty ignoring distractions. People facing mental health challenges may process information more slowly.
    The fear of not having enough time to complete tasks can worsen stress and anxiety, which can further reduce cognitive function.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is important to note that many people need time to read the “timeout”
    notice. Often, the session ends before the user has finished reading about
    how to extend the time. In addition, if the user is looking up information, they will not
    see the timeout notice.
  </p>
  <p>
    Give as much notice for timeouts as you can without compromising security and safety. 
    Telling users at the start of the process when the timeout will occur and what action 
    will be needed can also help the user extend the timeout successfully.
  </p>

  <h5 class="coga-5">More Details</h5>
  <p>
    When a web site must timeout because sensitive information (such as credit
    card information) is entered or displayed, the web site should ask for the
    sensitive information at the last stage.
  </p>
  <p>
    The web site should also warn the user that once they give the credit card
    information they should complete the process quickly as the session can
    timeout.

  <h5 class="coga-5">Examples</h5>
  <p><span class="use"></span><strong>Use:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>Unlimited time, when possible.</li>
    <li>
      Timeouts that users with learning and cognitive disabilities find it easy
      to avoid. For example: At the start of the task the user is told that they
      have a day to complete the task. They have an option to set it to longer.
    </li>
    <li>
      When the timeout is needed:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Timeout warnings at the start of the task.</strong> For
          example: In an auction, there is a time limit on the amount of time a
          user has to submit a bid. At the start of the task, the user is warned
          about the time limit, and how long they have until the time ends. At the start of
          the task/process, also tell the users what they need to do to extend the time out 
          as it may take them time to read the notice.

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>When possible and safe, the user’s work is not lost.</strong>
          For example: A web site with sensitive information uses a client-side
          time limit to help protect users who may step away from their
          computers. When the user logs in again all the work is still in place.
          The user is warned ahead of time how long they have for inactive
          sessions and is told that their data will not be lost.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p><span class="avoid"></span><strong>Avoid:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>System timeouts that are not necessary for security.</li>
    <li>
      System timeouts without warning the user at the start of the process.
    </li>
    <li>
      System timeouts where the user loses their work, without it being a
      security or privacy risk.
    </li>
  </ol>
