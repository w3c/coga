    <p>
      I need time to complete my work. I do not want a session to timeout while
      I try to find the information needed, such as my postal/zip code or social
      security number.

  <h5 class="coga-5">What to do</h5>
  <p>Avoid timeouts and let the user save their work as they go.</p>
  <p>
    When this is not possible, inform the user when they initiate the process:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>the amount of time available to complete the process,</li>
    <li>if the user will lose entered data if a timeout occurs.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If a method is available to extend the time:
 </p>
  <ul>
    <li>explain how to do it,</li>
    <li>tell users what to expect in advance.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
  <p>
    Timed events can present significant barriers for users with
    <a>cognitive and learning disabilities</a>. These users may require more
    time to read content or to perform functions, such as completing an online
    form. They may need to read help or look at notes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Users with <a>cognitive and learning disabilities</a> may need additional
    time to look up the information required to complete a transaction. They may
    need a break, without losing their place in the process, and without losing
    data that has already been entered.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, while making a purchase on an e-commerce web site, a user does
    not remember required information. This may be a date, a phone number, or a
    zip code that may seem easy to remember for users without a cognitive or
    learning disability. They need to look up this information, which takes them
    time away from the screen. Then they need to copy it carefully into the
    form.
  </p>

  <p>
    In another example, a user is completing an online process for reserving a
    hotel room and purchasing a plane ticket. They become overwhelmed with the
    amount of instruction and data input required to complete the process. The
    user cannot complete the process in one sitting, and takes a break.
  </p>

  <p>
    Users’ cognitive skills may diminish as they get tired. They then must stop
    the task for that day. When users know that their data won’t be lost, they
    can recover from mental fatigue and return to successfully complete the
    task.
  </p>
  <p>
    People facing mental health challenges, often process information more slowly because
    of cognitive challenges like memory problems, trouble staying focused, and difficulty 
    ignoring distractions. The fear of not having enough time to complete tasks can worsen 
    stress and anxiety, which may result in further reduced cognitive function.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is important to note that many people need time to read the “timeout”
    notice. Often, the session ends before the user has finished reading about
    how to extend the time. If the user is looking up information, they will not
    see the timeout notice.
  </p>

  <h5 class="coga-5">More Details</h5>
  <p>
    When a web site must timeout because sensitive information (such as credit
    card information) is entered or displayed, the web site should ask for the
    sensitive information at the last stage.
  </p>
  <p>
    The web site should also warn the user that once they give the credit card
    information they should complete the process quickly as the session can
    timeout.

  <h5 class="coga-5">Examples</h5>
  <p><span class="use"></span><strong>Use:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>Unlimited time, when possible.</li>
    <li>
      Timeouts that users with learning and cognitive disabilities find it easy
      to avoid. For example: At the start of the task the user is told that they
      have a day to complete the task. They have an option to set it to longer.
    </li>
    <li>
      When the timeout is needed:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Timeout warnings at the start of the task.</strong> For
          example: In an auction, there is a time limit on the amount of time a
          user has to submit a bid. At the start of the task, the user is warned
          about the time limit, and how long they have until the time ends.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>When possible and safe, the user’s work is not lost.</strong>
          For example: A web site with sensitive information uses a client-side
          time limit to help protect users who may step away from their
          computers. When the user logs in again all the work is still in place.
          The user is warned ahead of time how long they have for inactive
          sessions and is told that their data will not be lost.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p><span class="avoid"></span><strong>Avoid:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>System timeouts that are not necessary for security.</li>
    <li>
      System timeouts without warning the user at the start of the process.
    </li>
    <li>
      System timeouts where the user loses their work, without it being a
      security or privacy risk.
    </li>
  </ol>
