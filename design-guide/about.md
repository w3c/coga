This guide provides assistance making web sites and applications friendly for
people with <a>cognitive and learning disabilities</a>. The patterns in this
guide provide practical guidance to improve the accessibility of designs and
the design process.

The objectives and patterns presented here provide
<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/#supplement">
supplemental guidance</a>
beyond the requirements of The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines WCAG
[[WCAG22]]. They are intended to address barriers that could not be included
in the normative WCAG [[WCAG22]] specification and may not otherwise be
addressed.

This guide is divided into design objectives. An outline of these objectives
can also be found in the <a href="#summary">summary section</a>. Simply understanding the objectives
and related user stories may help designers make content more accessible to
some users with <a>cognitive and learning disabilities</a>.

Each objective contains a number of practical patterns (repeated designs for
controls and other elements) that describe what to do to address user needs.
Implementing these patterns is <strong>essential</strong> for some people with
<a>cognitive and learning disabilities</a> to be able to use content
independently.
