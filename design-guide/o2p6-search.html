  <h5 class="coga-5">What to Do</h5>
  <p>Provide a logical organization and structure that is easy to navigate.</p>
  <p>Divide long pieces of media into segments that are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>logical,</li>
    <li>short,</li>
    <li>labeled,</li>
    <li>easy to identify, and</li>
    <li>easy to reach or jump to.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
  <p>
    Using a clear, logical structure, with headings allows users to orient and
    navigate through the content easily even if they get distracted or lose
    focus. This is particularly important for people with an attention
    impairment.
  </p>
  <p>
    Providing short logical segments help users find and focus on a specific
    topic. If the user loses concentration they can find their place in the
    material and start again from the last point that they remember. This is
    especially important for educational content or instructions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Chunking media also allows for each segment to be given a unique URI. It can
    then be easily referenced and shared.
  </p>
  <p>For example:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Some videos can be naturally organized into chapters or segments.</li>
    <li>
      A podcast can be split into segments rather than a single one-hour
      recording.
    </li>
  </ul>

          <p>
            Provide a friendly search capability. Ideally search should include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>autocomplete,</li>
            <li>
              grouping of results when appropriate with headings for each group,
            </li>
            <li>ability to easily find previous searches, and</li>
            <li>spell-checking.</li>
          </ul>

        <section>
          <h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
          <p>
            Having a search capability allows users to find the content they
            need even if they cannot use the site menus. A user can learn how to
            use search and reuse that skill on many sites.
          </p>
          <p>
            Menu systems and most site navigation require the user to understand
            the menu categories. Users with impaired
            <a>executive function</a> may be unable to identify the correct
            categories.
          </p>
          <p>
            In some cases, users know the correct category via memory, rather
            than logic. For example, most users remember that the print function
            is often found under the file menu. Users with impaired memory may
            not be able to find these menu items based on recall.
          </p>
          <p>
            Users with impaired short-term memory,
            <a>age related forgetfulness</a>, or who are easily distracted may
            also find navigating a site and going to many pages to look for
            content difficult. If it takes too long they may lose focus and
            forget what they are looking for.
          </p>
          <p>
            Search is most useful when it corrects misspellings, finds
            appropriate or related content, and provides suggested
            auto-corrected versions of the search terms.
          </p>
          <p>
            If there are many results from related topics, it helps if search
            results are presented under the appropriate heading and categories.
            This helps the user find the search results they are looking for.

          <h5 class="coga-5">More Details</h5>
          <p>
            Search is less important on small sites where every page is no more
            than two clicks away from the main page.
