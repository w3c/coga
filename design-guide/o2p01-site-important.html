    <p>
      I need to find it easy to identify the content that I need, and do not
      need. Information I need to know and important information stands out, or
      is the first thing I read and does not get lost in the noise of less
      important information.

  <h5 class="coga-5">What to Do</h5>
  <p>
    Make important tasks and features on the site stand out and easy to find.
  </p>
  <p>This includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>On the home page, calling out key tasks for the web site.</li>
    <li>
      Using call out boxes or sections of the home page for these tasks and
      features.
    </li>
    <li>Giving the most important tasks/features visual weight.</li>
    <li>
      Placing the tasks/features towards the top of the page so the user does
      not have to scroll to see them.
    </li>
    <li>
      Placing the tasks/features toward the top of the content so assistive
      technology finds them quickly.
    </li>
    <li>Providing useful headings for each key task or feature.</li>
    <li>Including key tasks at a top level of the main navigation.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
  <p>
    People with impaired <a>executive function</a>, impaired memory, and other
    <a>cognitive and learning disabilities</a> may have difficulty determining
    what they can do on a site. By calling out important tasks and features,
    people can more quickly determine whether the site will meet their needs.
  </p>

  <p>
    For example, a user goes to a web site to buy tickets. He sees many reviews
    and other information but cannot see how to buy the tickets. The user leaves
    the site.

    Make important features and tasks both visually and programmatically
    prominent. See The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines WCAG [[WCAG22]].

  <h5 class="coga-5">Getting started</h5>
  <p>Start by thinking about what are the key tasks for the user.</p>
  <p>Include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The most common tasks users want to perform.</li>
    <li>Tasks that may affect usersâ€™ health or well-being.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Usage data can normally identify the most common tasks. Focus groups and
    surveys are also useful for identifying what users want.
  </p>

  <h5 class="coga-5">Examples</h5>
  <p><span class="use"></span><strong>Use:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      The most important tasks are directly on the main page and in visually
      distinct boxes. For example, important tasks on a library site might be:
      searching, signing up for a library card, locating a branch, and reserving
      a conference room.
    </li>
    <li>The most used features are near the top of the page.</li>
  </ol>
  <p><span class="avoid"></span><strong>Avoid:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Items that the team wish to promote more prominently placed than the main
      reason for users coming to the site. For example: A library web site only
      includes upcoming events on the main page. Users have to click through non
      obvious links to search for books, signing up for a library card, locating
      a branch, or reserving a conference room.
    </li>
    <li>
      Positioning information users are likely to want so they have to scroll,
      or page down, to find it.
    </li>
  </ol>
