<p>
  Some users have impaired language skills. More of these users understand
  content which uses <a>easy to understand language</a>. For example, someone
  with a language impairment may be able to understand simple sentences and
  common words. However, complex language with uncommon words may be
  inaccessible to them.
</p>
<p>Help users understand the message and purpose of the page by using:</p>
<ul>
  <li>easy to understand words,</li>
  <li>short sentences,</li>
  <li>simple tense,</li>
  <li>short blocks of text,</li>
  <li>unambiguous content,</li>
  <li>clear images, and</li>
  <li>easy to understand videos.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  A good visual layout and small chunks of text makes content easier to
  understand. Use whitespace and good separation of foreground from background
  to help comprehension. Also, avoid relying on numerical or mathematical
  skills.
