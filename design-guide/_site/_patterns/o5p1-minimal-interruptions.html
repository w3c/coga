  <h5 class="coga-5">What to Do</h5>
  <p>Avoid interruptions. This includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Providing an easy way to control interruptions, reminders, and changes in
      content unless they are started by the user or involve an emergency.
    </li>
    <li>
      Allowing the user to control and limit types of content which could cause
      them distraction or an undesirable reaction.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This content includes: Social media, violent content, advertisements,
    distracting backgrounds and images, moving content, soft and loud noises, or
    triggers.
  </p>

  <h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
  <p>
    Interruptions stop people with memory or attention impairments from
    completing their task. This can include individuals with Dementia, those
    that have had a stroke or <a>brain injury</a>, and those taking medications
    with side effects impacting memory or attention. Certain types of
    interruptions or a certain number may cause them to stop, even if the task
    is very important. Interruptions can include sounds, content that visually
    appears or changes (such as advertisements on a page). Interruptions can be
    as simple as text notifications about the presence of new changes while
    working in a shared online document.
  </p>
  <p>
    A site will work best for those with memory or attention challenges if they
    have:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>a quiet and simple environment,</li>
    <li>no interruptions at all,</li>
    <li>
      an easy to use pause option so interruptions and moving content can be
      viewed later, or
    </li>
    <li>
      a setting where users can select which types of interruptions they can
      manage and when.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Many news web sites have a lot of interruptions that can cause challenges
    for people needing to read important information, such as school closures
    due to bad weather. They may encounter breaking news text, advertisements,
    and pop-up windows. For those with difficulty focusing and sifting through
    the school names, or have two or three they need to check, these
    distractions may make the task impossible. By letting the user pause these
    distractions, and ideally temporarily remove them from the page, they will
    better be able to complete the task.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some people are sensitive to noise and can easily become overwhelmed by too
    many stimuli.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sometimes, noises and different types of content may adversely affect
    <a>mental health</a>. For example, noises, distractions, or distressing
    content may make the user more anxious or possibly trigger post-traumatic
    stress disorder (PTSD). There has also been research to suggest that too
    many interruptions and use of social media may aggravate depression and
    difficulty focusing. Allowing users to control this content could help them
    be more productive online.
  </p>
  <p>
    Where standard techniques exist to remove or control distractions, they
    should be used.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, a person with traumatic <a>brain injury</a> is filling out
    their taxes online. The social media application pings them with
    notifications. They try to turn notifications off and then they try to turn
    off the application, but it is too complex. They are unable to submit their
    taxes without help.

  <h5 class="coga-5">Examples</h5>

  <p><span class="use"> </span><strong>Use:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>Tasks without interruptions.</li>
    <li>
      An easy way to control interruptions that may be needed. For example:
      <ul>
        <li>
          An application lets the user decide how they want to be notified about
          reminders and emails. Users can choose visual reminders, sounds, or
          none. They can flag users as essential contacts who can interrupt in
          most cases. These settings are easy to find from every screen. For
          some users, not having any notifications enables them to focus on a
          task and then go to their emails or calendar when the task is
          completed.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p><span class="avoid"></span><strong>Avoid:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Distracting content that is hard to turn off, or cannot be turned off. For
      example:
      <ul>
        <li>
          There are advertisements on a magazine article page that constantly
          change, interrupting a reader’s focus.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Content that interrupts the user from completing their task. For example:
      <ul>
        <li>
          A pop up suggesting the user subscribers to the site. The pop up must
          be closed for the user to continue.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
