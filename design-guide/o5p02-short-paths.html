  <h5 class="coga-5">What to Do</h5>
  <p>
    Streamline processes and workflows so that they include only the minimally
    necessary steps. Separate out optional steps that are supplemental but not
    required. Do not require the user to go through optional steps.
  </p>

  <h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
  <p>
    With each step and option in a process, cognitive load increases. Tasks can become too hard 
    and overwhelming and users may fail or give up. Further, complicated designs such as
    complex registration or purchasing processes, often increase anxiety, further impacting cognitive functioning.
  </p>
  <p>
    Streamlining processes and workflows reduces distractions, mistakes, mental fatigue and anxiety.
    Using short critical path help users with <a>cognitive and learning disabilities</a>
    and mental health challenges successfully and accurately complete a process or task.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, a user with <a>early stage dementia</a> is trying to buy a new
    phone. Before they can pay, steps are added to the checkout process, offering them headphones and
    other items. The user is forced to accept or deny these options. They become overwhelmed and confused.
    They leave the site without buying the phone.

  <h5 class="coga-5">Examples</h5>
  <p><span class="use"></span><strong>Use:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Processes that only require necessary steps.
      <ul>
        <li>
          For example: The steps included in the online process to buy movie
          tickets are:
          <ul>
            <li>select a movie,</li>
            <li>select the date and time,</li>
            <li>select seats,</li>
            <li>pay,</li>
            <li>print or save tickets.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The movie theater allows the user to view descriptions about the
            movie and ratings, buy snacks ahead of time, and donate to a
            charity. These actions, or steps, are not required in order for the
            user to complete the task of purchasing a movie ticket. Instead of
            requiring the user make these selections as part of the purchasing
            process, the user is given these options before the process is
            started and after it is complete.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Short navigation to key features. For example, for the most used function
      in an app:
      <ul>
        <li>open the app,</li>
        <li>run the most used function.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p><span class="avoid"></span><strong>Avoid:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Adding unnecessary steps. For example, the steps included in the online
      process to buy movie tickets are:
      <ul>
        <li>select a movie,</li>
        <li>select the date and time,</li>
        <li>select seats,</li>
        <li>purchase snacks ahead of time or opt out,</li>
        <li>make a charitable donation or opt out,</li>
        <li>create an account,</li>
        <li>pay,</li>
        <li>print tickets.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    The movie theater forces users to decide on snacks and make a charitable
    donation before paying for their tickets. While an opt out option is
    available, it is somewhat hidden on the screen, particularly on mobile
    devices, and users often stop when they cannot figure out how to pay.
  </p>
  <ol start="2">
    <li>
      Long navigation for the most used features. For example, for the most used
      function in an app:
      <ul>
        <li>go to the applications introduction page, press continue,</li>
        <li>go to the applications main page,</li>
        <li>go to a sub page,</li>
        <li>select an option,</li>
        <li>select another option,</li>
        <li>run the most used function.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
