  <blockquote>
    <p>
      I need to understand the meaning of the text. I do not want unexplained,
      implied, or ambiguous information because I may misunderstand jokes and
      metaphors.

  <h5 class="coga-5">What to Do</h5>
  <p>
    Provide definitions or explanations for implied or ambiguous information
    such:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>body gestures,</li>
    <li>emotions,</li>

    <li>jokes,</li>

    <li>sarcasm,</li>
    <li>metaphors and simile, and</li>
    <li>facial expressions.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These definitions and explanations should be provided in text close to the
    implied content or in the markup (see best practices).
  </p>

  <h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
  <p>
    Implied content can be difficult for some users because the meaning is not
    clear. This includes abstract content, sarcasm, or metaphors. The meaning is
    not clear and requires the user to have additional knowledge to understand.
  </p>

  <p>
    When using body gestures, emotional communication, and facial expressions as
    the only way to communicate something, it is important to include this in
    another way to ensure all users understand. One way this can be done is
    through supplementary text.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, an image is used in a social media post to communicate a
    person’s true feelings. Some individuals may not be able to understand the
    emotion being demonstrated by the image. They miss the point the author is
    trying to make without more context.
  </p>
  <p>
    Similarly, a research study asked <a>autistic</a> people to watch a movie
    that had a lot of implied content. They were watching the actors’ mouths,
    but information such as sarcasm is communicated by their facial expressions.
    When asked what happened in the movie, some missed the implied communication
    and the point of the dialogue.

  <h5 class="coga-5">More Details</h5>
  <p>This includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      graphics used alone to identify that something is important, or should be
      remembered,
    </li>
    <li>sarcasm in text, and</li>
    <li>
      animations used to add importance or communicate something contrary to the
      literal meaning of the paired text.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Note that standard emojis often come with an explanation or alternative
    text.

  <h5 class="coga-5">Examples</h5>
  <p><span class="use"></span><strong>Use:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Supplementary text such as (sarcasm) when writing sarcastic comments in
      emails and social media posts to help readers understand the intent of the
      communication.
    </li>
    <li>
      Personalization semantics (once it is mature) to add non-literal text
      alternatives. See [[personalization-semantics-help-1.0]].
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p><span class="avoid"></span><strong>Avoid:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Unexplained metaphors and similes. For example: “You are my sunshine.”
