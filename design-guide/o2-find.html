<p>
  Users with <a>cognitive and learning disabilities</a> may have trouble finding
  the content they need. They may also struggle to orient themselves inside the
  content or task. Users should be able to quickly and easily locate what they
  are looking for. Use a clear and easy layout to help users navigate the system
  easily. For example:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Make anything related to safety or that the user needs to know easy to
    identify without reading a lot of text!
  </li>
  <li>
    Provide a clear site structure and hierarchy will help users navigate to the
    page they need.
  </li>
  <li>
    Make the most important things easy to find in the site and on each page.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use good visual cues (like icons) with clear headings, boundaries, and
    regions to help users understand the page design. This makes the page
    navigation easier.
  </li>
  <li>
    Provide a search facility or breadcrumbs to help users find things on the
    site.
  </li>
  <li>Break media into chunks to allow users to easily find sections.</li>
