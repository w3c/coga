  <h5 class="coga-5">What to Do</h5>
  <p>Help the user know the purpose of the content. Use:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>a clear title or heading that summarizes the purpose of a page, or</li>
    <li>
      other clear signposts that have been tested by users with
      <a>cognitive and learning disabilities</a>.
    </li>
    <li>minimum number of topics a page/screen covers</li>
    <li>use a single page/screen area to group hyperlinks related to a specific topic</li>
  </ul>

  <h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
  <p>
    This helps many people, including those with impaired memory and attention
    as well as anyone who is easily distracted due to
    <a>age-related forgetfulness</a> and <a>AD(H)D</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, someone with mild dementia is using online shopping. They get
    distracted and then when they look at the screen again they have forgotten
    what they were doing. A clear heading at the top of each page shows clearly
    <strong>what the page is about and what they are doing</strong>.
    
  </p>
  <p>
    Similarly, diverse topics and complicated designs on websites and apps can be quite hard
    for people with severe mental illness to understand and use. Limiting the 
    number of topics or subjects on a page or screen makes the purpose of the page/screen
    clear and makes the navigation easy.
  </p>
  <p>
    In another example, a user with <a>AD(H)D</a> is looking for information in
    a video. They can tell by the video title that this video has the
    information they need.

  <h5 class="coga-5">More Details</h5>
  <p>Headings clarify the purpose of this specific page.</p>
  <p>
    When possible, provide information to help users understand how they got to
    the page. For example: clearly indicating breadcrumbs on main navigation,
    highlighting currently selected tab, etc.

  <h5 class="coga-5">Examples</h5>
  <p>
    <strong><span class="use"></span>Use:</strong>
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Page headings that tell the user where they are.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    <strong><span class="avoid"></span>Avoid:</strong>
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Pages without clear headings or signposts that tell the user where they
      are. For example:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Page headings that do not tell the user where they are, such as a page
          heading that reads “Service not available”. The user has to remember
          what the service relates to.
        </li>
        <li>Page headings that do not clarify the steps in a form.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
