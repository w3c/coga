  <h5 class="coga-5">What to Do</h5>
  <p>Use short blocks of text</p>
  <p>This includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Keep paragraphs short. Have only one topic in each paragraph.</li>
    <li>Try to have the aim of the paragraph or chunk at the beginning.</li>
    <li>Use short sentences. Have only one point per sentence.</li>
    <li>Use bulleted or numbered lists.</li>
    <li>Use short descriptive headings.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
  <p>
    Chunking text content makes it easier to read and understand. This helps
    people with learning or cognitive disabilities related to processing speed
    or language. People with a memory impairment or anyone who is easily
    distracted will also benefit. Chunking is also helpful to anyone who is
    multitasking. Try to put the aim or purpose at the beginning of each chunk
    or paragraph.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, a graduate student with <a>AD(H)D</a> may need to teach
    themselves a new software skill. The software documentation is broken up
    into short paragraphs and lists by topic. The student finds the
    documentation easy to read and understand.

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>What is a short paragraph? </strong>In English, if you have a
      paragraph of more than 50 words, try breaking it up into two paragraphs.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong
        >How can I avoid writing a sentence with more than one point? </strong
      >Sentences that have more than one point usually have more than one
      linking word such as “and” or “but”.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong
        >Can a long sentence ever be clearer than two short sentences? </strong
      >Double-check if a long sentence is clearer than two short sentences. Do
      usability testing to see if people with
      <a>cognitive and learning disabilities</a> find the long sentence easier
      to understand.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>When should I use lists? </strong>Lists are great when you have
      three or more things in a row. Think about using an unordered list (with
      bullet points) for items, requirements, and exceptions. A series of three
      or more steps is easier to follow as a numbered list.

          Calgary will have a lot of snow and hail this weekend. Try not to
          drive. If you must drive:
          <ul>
            <li>Use the rules for driving in winter to keep safe.</li>
            <li>
              Before you leave, check what roads are safe at the Traveler’s
              Information web site.

          DOTD Issues Winter Weather Travel Advisory for Calgary. With the
          possibility of snow and rain in the forecast throughout the holiday
          weekend, the Department of Transportation and Development (DOTD)
          announced that department staff is prepared to deal with winter
          weather. Maintenance forces will be on standby to apply sand and salt
          over any affected bridges and roadways, to remove fallen trees from
          the roadway, and to close any roads as needed. Interim Secretary Jane
          Doe urges motorists to take the threat of winter weather seriously.
          “In the event of adverse weather conditions, the department will
          strive to maintain access to highways and interstates; however, we
          encourage the motoring public to avoid traveling during snow and ice,
          if at all possible,” said Doe.
