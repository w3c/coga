  <h5 class="coga-5">What to Do</h5>
  <p>
    In instructions, separate each step. State each step clearly. This includes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>including all steps, even those you think are “obvious”,</li>
    <li>using numbers and lists can also help,</li>
    <li>
      providing complex instructions in an if/then table, which can be easier to
      follow, or
    </li>
    <li>using friendly graphics can help make instructions less scary.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
  <p>
    Step-by-step instructions benefit many people such as people with language
    impairments, processing difficulties, or a memory impairment.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, a person with an impaired working memory cannot hold onto many
    pieces of information at the same time. They are more likely to make
    mistakes if they need to remember what they are doing, divide the steps, and
    track what they have done. When instructions are clearly separated and laid
    out, they can follow them without making mistakes.

  <h5 class="coga-5">Examples</h5>
  <p><span class="use"></span><strong>Use:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>Bullet points to separate each step.</li>
    <li>
      An if/then table to separate steps based on conditions. For example:
      <table
        title="if then table example"
        style="border: 1px solid black; border-collapse: collapse"
      >
        <tr>
          <th style="border: 1px solid black"><strong>If</strong></th>
          <th style="border: 1px solid black"><strong>Then</strong></th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td style="border: 1px solid black">
            If you want to work in programing:
          </td>
          <td style="border: 1px solid black">
            <ul>
              <li>Make a resume.</li>
              <li>Get some sample code that you wrote.</li>
              <li>Send them to programing@example.com.</li>
            </ul>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td style="border: 1px solid black">
            If you want to work in design:
          </td>
          <td style="border: 1px solid black">
            <ul>
              <li>Make a resume.</li>
              <li>Get some sample pages that you designed.</li>
              <li>Send them to design@example.com.</li>
            </ul>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p><span class="avoid"></span><strong>Avoid:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      More than one step in the same block of text without separation. For
      example:
      <ul>
        <li>
          If you want to work in programing, write to programing@example.com
          with a resume and sample code that you wrote. If you want to work in
          design, write to design@example.com with a resume and sample pages.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
