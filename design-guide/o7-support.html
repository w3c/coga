title: Provide Help and Support
summary: This includes **making it easy to get human help.** If users
        have difficulty sending feedback, then you will never know if they are
        able to use the content or when they are experiencing problems. In
        addition, **support different ways to understand content.** Graphics,
        summaries of long documents, adding icons to headings and links, and
        alternatives for numbers are all examples of extra help and support."

<p>
  Support different ways of understanding content. Provide extra help and
  support such as:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>graphics,</li>
  <li>summaries of long documents,</li>
  <li>icons with headings and links, and</li>
  <li>alternatives for numbers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Explain choices to help the user successfully complete their tasks.</p>
<p>
  Make it easy for users get help when they run into difficulties and give
  feedback. If users have difficulty sending feedback, they cannot tell you if
  they are unable to use the content. You will not know when they are
  experiencing problems.
</p>
<p>
  Some applications depend on user data, such as smart cities. Data from users
  who cannot use the system can be missing from data driven systems. The problem
  is worse when they cannot even give feedback about their problems. They become
  invisible and their needs are not met.
