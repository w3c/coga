<p>
  Users should be able to avoid mistakes and correct them easily if mistakes
  occur.
</p>
<p>
  It is difficult for many users to complete forms, especially people with
  <a>cognitive and learning disabilities</a>. A good design makes errors less
  likely.
</p>
<p>
  Users with <a>cognitive and learning disabilities</a> are more likely to make
  mistakes. This can include entering information incorrectly or accidently
  touching the wrong control. Help the user notice form errors and make it easy
  to correct them. Always let users go back and recover if they accidentally
  touch a control.
</p>
<p>
  Completing forms and similar tasks is often overwhelming for people with
  <a>cognitive and learning disabilities</a>. Many users with
  <a>cognitive and learning disabilities</a> cannot remember numbers, such as
  zip or post codes or their social security number. Many users even need to
  check their phone numbers. This makes entering information slow, and they may
  need to leave their desks or take breaks. Help them by providing a design that
  reduces mistakes. Give them the time they need without annoying timeouts and
  data loss.
