  <h5 class="coga-5">What to Do</h5>
  <p>
    Carefully design the layout of the page. Make sure it has a clear structure
    and hierarchy so that it is easy to understand and navigate.
  </p>
  <p>This can be achieved by:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>organizing the page content into logical sections,</li>
    <li>Simplifying navigation by having fewer navigation areas,</li>
    <li>
      clearly differentiating regions using dividing lines, whitespace, and
      background colors,
    </li>
    <li>
      providing headings and other visual cues to indicate the structure and
      purpose of the regions,
    </li>
    <li>making any relationship between regions of the page clear, and</li>
    <li>
      using visual indicators to help people understand:
      <ul>
        <li>structure and relative importance of the page content,</li>
        <li>the grouping and association of items, and</li>
        <li>when items have a different purpose to surrounding information.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>

  <p>
    People with <a>cognitive and learning disabilities</a> may not be able to
    use content and applications when the page structure and relationships are
    unclear. The user may not complete tasks and miss key information. The user
    may not return to pages that are complicated to use and understand.
  </p>
<p>
  Use of fewer navigational areas reduces the cognitive efforts required,
  particularly for persons having SMI (Severe Mental Illness) and potentially others. 
  These may include those with cognitive impairments and limited skills or experience with technology.
  <p>
  <p>
    Clear, well organized page layouts enable users to easily find key
    information. They can focus on their tasks instead of working out what is on
    the page. Using a standard visual layout, and positioning elements
    consistently, will help users rely on muscle memory and use them. This
    supports people with disabilities that impact their problem solving skills,
    slow readers, or people who get overwhelmed when presented with a lot of
    text. This includes:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>A good structure:</strong> Organization of page content into
    sections, each with an obvious purpose, allows users to more easily locate
    and focus on the sections they need. Content that is not directly relevant
    to the main purpose of a page should be distinctly separated.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Use borders and shading to group:</strong> Grouping information
    using a border or color shading makes it easier for people to identify
    groups.
  </p>

  <p>For example:</p>
  <img
    alt="3 rows of 8 evenly spaced circles divided into two blue rectangles.  The blue backgrounds make the two groupings visually apparent."
    src="img/common-region-1.png"
  />
  <img
    alt="4 circles divided into two sets of two by a contrasting border. Each set has a blue and a white circle. The white circles are adjacent but border clearly indicates the sets."
    src="img/common-region-2.png"
  />
  <p>Figure: Example of grouping with shading and borders.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Visual cues:</strong> People who have difficulty recognizing or
    comprehending written language or concentrating, can find graphical cues
    easier to process. Examples of common graphical indicators and visual cues
    include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>grouping summaries of content,</li>
    <li>using a card design using colors or white space,</li>
    <li>flagging important information, such as using call out boxes, and</li>
    <li>
      indicating different types of information, such as placing quotes in
      speech bubbles.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h5 class="coga-5">More Details</h5>
  <p>
    If pages have a lot of content, check that content is grouped and you can
    see what is related.
  </p>
  <p>Making regions and a clear page structure can include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Clearly label content categories, and use familiar visual cues and icons.
      This will help recognition and retrieval rather than rely on memory. The
      background color can be a clear divider if the contrast is strong enough.
    </li>
    <li>
      The heading structure should create an outline of the document that could
      serve as an abstract of the whole document.
    </li>
    <li>
      Ensure navigation areas are easy to find. Ensure that users know what to expect in each area.
      It is also important that users know what to ignore. Using fewer navigational areas can improve simplicity.
      If you have many navigation regions, ensure they are clear and accessible, so that users are not overwhelmed.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you have five or more landmarks, check if they are all needed. 
      Ensure the landmark names are clear and describe their purpose. It help all users, including 
      screen reader users, know what to expect in each section. Make sure the accessible labels
      for landmarks are easy to understand. They can be non-visible, but they still need to be clear
      (e.g., names like "primary," "secondary," and "tertiary" may not make sense).
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Icons should be used consistently. It is also important the graphical
    indicators do not clutter the interface. Too many icons can add to the
    cognitive load for users to process. Examples of clear dividers include high
    contrast borders or white space. A change in background color can be a clear
    divider if the contrast is strong enough.

  <h5 class="coga-5">Examples</h5>
  <p><span class="use"></span><strong>Use:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Well separated sections of content. White space, borders, or call outs are
      used to separate sections.
    </li>
    <li>
      Headings and icons to help define sections of content. This organizes the
      information on the page so it is easier to understand the layout and find
      specific information.
    </li>
    <li>Call outs boxes.</li>
  </ol>
  <p><span class="avoid"></span><strong>Avoid:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>Dense text, with little white space.</li>
    <li>Unclear page structure and hierarchy.</li>
    <li>Lack of visually differentiated sections.</li>
    <li>
      Sections without headings or icons that define sections. For example: A
      web page has chunks of content run into each other with a “flat design”.
      Many users with cognitive disabilities will find it challenging or
      impossible to work out which chunks belong together. Thus, all the
      benefits of chunking content are lost.
    </li>
    <li>Groups and page sections that are not logical.</li>
  </ol>
