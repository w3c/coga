  <h5 class="coga-5">What to Do</h5>
  <p>
    Provide users with a way to personalize their interface to make it familiar.
  </p>
  <p>This can be done by:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Allowing user preferences on presentation such as font style, font size,
      line heights, margins, and contrast. (Note: The default version should
      still be readable and use clear fonts.)
    </li>
    <li>
      Allowing a rollback to a previous interface that the user is familiar with
      and knows how to use.
    </li>
    <li>
      Adding semantics on controls, links, and symbols that allow the user to
      control the experience. For example:
      <ul>
        <li>HTML5 autocomplete on common fields,</li>
        <li>adding a toolbar that adds personalized images,</li>
        <li>use attributes in [[personalization-semantics-1.0]].</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Ensure the user knows the personalization options and can easily configure
    them. Clear instructions can help.
  </p>

  <h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
  <p>Personalization changes the interface to meet the needs of the user.</p>

  <p>
    Having familiar terms and symbols is key to many users being able to use the
    web. However, what is familiar for one user may be unfamiliar to another
    requiring them to learn new symbols. Adding semantics allows symbols and
    support to be added by an extension or browser that is familiar to the
    individual user.
  </p>
  <p>
    A stronger example is people using
    <abbr title="Alternative and Augmentative Communication System"
      ><a>AAC</a></abbr
    >. These users usually only learn one symbol set. They cannot easily
    communicate with other people using
    <abbr title="Alternative and Augmentative Communication System"
      ><a>AAC</a></abbr
    >
    in a written format or may struggle to understand different symbols used in
    different applications. When using personalization, such as
    [[personalization-semantics-1.0]] the user agents can load the symbols that
    are understandable by the individual user. The user can also access the Web
    and other applications.
  </p>

  <p>
    Other support includes autocomplete and extensions that help the user fill
    out forms and understand the content. Many users with memory or
    <a>executive function</a> impairments cannot fill in forms without asking
    someone to help copy over information or check their work. Autocomplete
    allows many more users to manage forms by themselves.

  <h5 class="coga-5">Getting Started</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Use the HTML autocomplete tags on all common fields.</li>
    <li>Add a toolbar that adds personalized images.</li>
    <li>
      Add the semantics that can work with a toolbar for personalized images.
    </li>
  </ul>
