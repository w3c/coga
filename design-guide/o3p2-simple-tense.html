  <h5 class="coga-5">What to Do</h5>
  <p>
    Use the tense and the voice that is easiest to understand. In English, this
    is usually the present tense and active voice. Speak directly to the user,
    and use the simplest form of verbs and sentence structure.
  </p>
  <p>
    Use local <a>plain language</a> guidance to find the tense and the voice
    that is easiest to understand in different languages.

  <h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
  <p>
    Using simple tense and voice benefits many people such as people with
    language impairments, dyslexia, or a memory impairment. For example, more
    people will understand “press the on button” (present tense and active
    voice) than “the on button should be pressed.” (passive voice).
  </p>
  <p>
    Active voice makes it clear who is supposed to take action. For example, “It
    must be done.” is passive voice ad does not say who must act. “You must do
    it.” is active voice and clearly states who has the action.
  </p>
  <p>
    Putting the aim of the sentence at the beginning can also make English
    sentences easier to follow. Local language experts may have additional
    linguistic advice that helps make content easy to understand.

  <h5 class="coga-5">More Details</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Use other voices or tenses when they will be easier to understand or
      friendlier.
    </li>
    <li>
      In languages where present tense and active voice do not exist or are not
      the clearest option, use the tense and the voice that are easiest to
      understand.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you are writing about past or future events, do not use the present
      tense. It will be confusing.
    </li>
