  <h5 class="coga-5">What to Do</h5>
  <p>
    Choose a form design that reduces the chance that the user will make a
    mistake. This includes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Requiring the user to enter as little information as possible.</li>
    <li>Clearly indicating required fields.</li>
    <li>
      In a text field, accepting as many formats as possible. For example,
      accepting different formats of phone numbers.
    </li>
    <li>
      Dividing long numbers into chunks (supporting autocomplete across fields).
    </li>
    <li>Using an interface where only valid input can be selected.</li>
    <li>Using autocomplete and personalization of form controls.</li>
    <li>Accepting voice prompts when supported by the operating system.</li>
    <li>Automatically correcting input errors when possible and reliable.</li>
    <li>Providing the user with known suggestions and corrections.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

  <h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
  <p>
    After making many errors, people with
    <a>cognitive and learning disabilities</a> and users with
    <a>age-related forgetfulness</a> often abandon their tasks and believe they
    cannot complete them. Error messages may be confusing. Correcting errors is
    often difficult and frustrating for users and increases cognitive fatigue.
    Many users need to stop when they get successive errors.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, while registering for an online banking account a form requires
    the input of the user’s birthdate. The required input format is xx/xx/xxxx
    with a leading zero for single digits. If a single input field with no input
    correction is presented, a user with a cognitive disability may enter
    1/3/1996 triggering an error notification. It may not be clear to the user
    that the required format is 01/03/1996 (even if the format is shown below
    the input field or in the error notification).
  </p>
  <p>
    A well-designed form makes it easier to fill in the information and prevents
    the user from making mistakes by automatically correcting or suggesting the
    correct date format.
  </p>
  <p>
    Minimizing user generated errors by automatically correcting them will also
    minimize error notifications. Error notifications may be tiring and
    distracting, taking focus away from tasks and task completion.

  <h5 class="coga-5">More Details</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Clearly mark required content.</li>
    <li>
      Only correct errors if the correction is reliable. Otherwise, if
      suggestions for corrections are known, give the suggestions to the user.
      <ul>
        <li>
          For example, “Did you mean the first of February (01/02) or the second
          of January (02/01)?”
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Calendars and dates.
      <ul>
        <li>
          Calendars should default to the first relevant day. Work calendars
          should default to the first working day of a user’s locale.
        </li>
        <li>
          Calendar-based booking systems must prevent the user from booking the
          return date before the departure date.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Temperature.
      <ul>
        <li>Use the default temperature format of the user’s location.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h5 class="coga-5">Examples</h5>
  <p><span class="use"></span><strong>Use:</strong></p>
  <p>Designs that make mistakes less likely. For example:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Correcting errors of the post code being written in the text field with
      the city or state information.
    </li>
    <li>
      Preventing the user from selecting inappropriate dates and providing a
      simple explanation if the user attempts to do so.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p><span class="avoid"></span><strong>Avoid:</strong></p>

  <p>Designs that make mistakes more likely. For example:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The booking form provides two calendars without clear labels and
      instructions. The form allows the user to select dates without warning as
      to whether they are possible e.g. flight out on June 1st - flight return
      May 30th.
    </li>
    <li>
      The system allows the user to select inappropriate dates without warning.
      The calendar merely grays out inappropriate dates which may not be
      noticed. No warnings are provided.
    </li>
  </ul>
