<p>
  Distractions can prevent users with
  <a>cognitive and learning disabilities</a> from completing their tasks.
</p>
<p>
  Once users become distracted, they may find it difficult to remember what they
  were doing. Then they can no longer complete their task. This is especially
  problematic for users with both impaired attention and impaired memory, such
  as users with dementia.
</p>
<p>
  Avoid using any content or elements that distract users or interrupt them.
  Also, consider removing content the user will find unnecessary. Provide clear
  headings and breadcrumbs to help users reorient and refocus if they lose
  focus.
</p>
<p>
  Also, help users maintain focus on their task by telling them what information
  they may need to prepare at the beginning of the task, so that they can
  collect all required information before starting.
