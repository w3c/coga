  <h5 class="coga-5">What to Do</h5>
  <p>
    Make sure starting points are:
  </p>
   <ul>
    <li>easy to get to,</li>
    <li>easy to orient,</li>
    <li>easy to find on each screen. </li>
    </ul>
<p>
For example: Make the starting point more visible and identifiable by using a predictable location, larger sizes, strong color contrast, and appealing icons for the home page logo or links.
</p>
<p>
Note: A site can have a different starting point for subsites and sections of the site.
For example, each facility of a university may have its own home page. In such a case the home page of both the site and the subsite that the user is on should be easy to get to. 
Placeholder-Todo add clarification of main page/landing page, and structure.

  <h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
  <p>
    Users often get lost and disoriented when using apps and websites. This is often aggravated 
by stress, mental health, and/or cognitive overload. Providing an easily identifiable starting point 
helps users know, they can always restart if they become disoriented or lost. 
</p>
</p>
Making starting points more visible and recognizable provides a more efficient way for people with cognitive disabilities to reorient themselves to complete their intended tasks.
</p>
<p>
  For example, a user with a cognitive disability navigates a wrong path during a search attempt or gets lost while exploring a website. 
If a home page link and logo are easily identifiable, the user can directly go to the home page.It assures them that they can restart anytime if lost.
They don't need to press the back button multiple times. This helps them restart their browsing task quickly.
It prevents the negative impact on their efficiency that may be caused by reading every page on the way back to the home page.
