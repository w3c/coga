  <h5 class="coga-5">What to Do</h5>
  <p>
    Make it easy to go directly to the home page of a site, subsite or app.
   To help users find the links to home page(s) on each screen, use: 
  </p>
   <ul>
    <li>a predictable location,</li>
    <li>large sizes fonts and icons,</li>
    <li>strong color contrast, and</li>
    <li>appealing icons or logos.</li>
    </ul>
<p>
Note the home page is sometimes referred to as the main screen (in an app) or
landing page of a set of screens or Web pages.
</p>
<p>
This guidance also applies to home pages for subsites and sections of the site. 
For example, each department of a university may have its own home page. 
In such a case, make it easy to go to the homepage of both the site and the subsite that the user is currently on.

  <h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
  <p>
   People who have cognitive and learning disabilities often get lost and disoriented when using apps and websites. 
 This is often aggravated by stress, mental health and/or cognitive overload. 
Providing an easily identifiable starting point helps users know that they
 can always restart if they become disoriented or lost. 
</p>
<p>
Making links to home page(s) more visible and recognizable provides a more efficient
way for people with cognitive disabilities to reorient themselves
 and complete their intended tasks.
</p>
<p>
  For example, a user with a cognitive and learning disabilities navigates a wrong path during a search attempt 
  or gets lost while exploring a website. If a home page link and logo are easily identifiable,
  the user can directly go to the home page. It assures them that they can restart anytime if lost.
  They don't need to press the back button multiple times. This helps them restart their browsing task quickly.
  It prevents the negative impact on their efficiency that may be caused by reading 
  every page on the way back to the home page.
