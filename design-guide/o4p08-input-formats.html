  <h5 class="coga-5">What to Do</h5>
  <p>
    Accept all format variations in text inputs for values such as currency,
    time zone, locale, address, or credit card number.

  <h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
  <p>
    Forgiving form entry processes help the user fill out forms, without an
    overwhelming amount of errors. They can avoid asking for help when errors
    cause them problems. This reduces frustration while enhancing the userâ€™s
    autonomy and independence.
  </p>

  <p>
    This benefits anybody with a learning and cognitive disability or
    <a>age related forgetfulness</a>. It will also help anyone who is used to a
    different format.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, a user with <a>age related forgetfulness</a> enters their phone
    number with hyphens inserted. They receive an error message, because the
    system does not accept that format. They wonder if they have forgotten their
    phone number or made a different mistake. They stop trying to use the form.

  <h5 class="coga-5">Examples</h5>
  <p><span class="use"></span><strong>Use:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>Platform facilities for flexible input types and validation.</li>
    <li>
      Research and support for different formats that might be entered,
      including international variations.
    </li>
    <li>Minimal required fields.</li>
    <li>
      Flexible input fields that accept different formats. For example, an input
      field that accepts:
      <ul>
        <li>various currency symbols,</li>
        <li>a credit card number with or without spaces,</li>
        <li>
          telephone numbers as written in many regions, including country code,
          region code, and number using optional brackets, and
        </li>
        <li>international characters such as those with accents.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p><span class="avoid"></span><strong>Avoid:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>Restricting entries to arbitrary lengths.</li>
    <li>
      Insisting on specific separator characters if they are not required and
      can be ignored.
    </li>
    <li>
      Input fields that do not accept the format that the user may use. For
      example:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Forcing users to use a specific currency value that they may not be
          their currency.
        </li>
        <li>
          A credit number field that requires no spaces even though cards have
          numbers printed with spaces.
        </li>
        <li>Telephone number field will not accept + codes or brackets.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
