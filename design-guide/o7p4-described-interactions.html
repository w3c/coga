  <h5 class="coga-5">What to Do</h5>
  <p>
    Provide help for any complex forms, particularly when there are multiple
    steps, unusual interactions, non-standard controls, and required fields that
    do not support autocomplete. Give examples that make it easy to understand
    what to do.
  </p>

  <h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
  <p>
    Users often find forms and related tasks to be the most complex experience
    with web sites. They can easily become confused, unsure, or even completely
    lost. Providing extra help can make the difference between being able to
    successfully complete a task and giving up. This is especially true if any
    part of the form is complex or requires nonstandard interactions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Many standard form controls provide support automatically. For example, many
    fields can be automatically filled in with information using autocomplete or
    personalization semantics [[personalization-semantics-content-1.0]]. Then
    the user will not make mistakes filling it out.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you require additional fields and nonstandard controls many users will
    have difficulty using them. Many users with disabilities will get the
    information incorrect or be unable to work out how to complete the task.
    Often this results in the task being completely abandoned. In other cases,
    the user asks a caregiver for help to complete the form or work the control.
    In either case, they have not been able to complete the task because of
    their disability.
  </p>
  <p>
    The standard [[HTML]] forms and controls have been carefully specified for
    maximum usability and accessibility. They are usually understood by users,
    especially if they are familiar with web interactions. However, users are
    likely to experience difficulties if the standard form behavior has been
    altered or completely new controls are provided. Assuming the new behaviors
    have been carefully designed and user tested, users may still require help
    in order to successfully use them.

  <h5 class="coga-5">More Details</h5>

  <p>
    Examples of forms and controls that are likely to require additional help:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Password fields that require certain character types of characters to be
      entered.
    </li>
    <li>
      Surveys with complex interactions, for example, where buttons only appear
      depending on previous answers.
    </li>
    <li>
      Date entry where there could be some ambiguity about the required format.
    </li>
    <li>
      Custom controls like date pickers where some dates may be grayed out.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h5 class="coga-5">Examples</h5>
  <p><span class="use"></span><strong>Use:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>Standard controls</li>
    <li>
      Non-standard controls and form fields with instructions or help. For
      example:
      <ul>
        <li>An accessible help button next to a nonstandard control.</li>
        <li>
          A standard mechanism for context sensitive help. This can include
          using personalization semantics for context sensitive help.
        </li>
        <li>Clear and unambiguous instructions that are easy to find.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p><span class="avoid"></span><strong>Avoid:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Non-standard controls and unusual form fields that do not have
      instructions or help. For example:
      <ul>
        <li>
          A form has a complex mechanism for enabling and disabling sections as
          you scroll or tab between them, but no help is provided.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
