  <h5 class="coga-5">What to Do</h5>
  <p>Keep the user safe. This includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Understand risks for people with learning and cognitive disabilities when
      providing personal information or communicating with others.
    </li>
    <li>
      Checking how safety and security techniques work with a wide range of
      customized profiles including aging users and users with learning and
      cognitive disabilities.
    </li>
    <li>Using known techniques to keep sensitive user information safe.</li>
    <li>
      Helping all users understand any relevant known risks. Explain any known
      risks in easy to understand and friendly language.
    </li>
    <li>This helps them make an informed decision and stay in control.</li>

  <h5 class="coga-5">How it Helps</h5>
  <p>
    Users need to know they are safe and secure when using a web site,
    especially when providing information or communicating with others.
  </p>

  <p>
    Users with impaired <a>executive function</a> are less likely to identify
    risks correctly so clearly identifying potential risks helps the user stay
    <strong>safe and in control</strong>. Add helpful tips for staying safe
    while using your content and provide help in case of problems.
  </p>
  <p>
    To help identify risks, we suggest holding research and focus groups with
    people with <a>cognitive and learning disabilities</a> and to work with
    people with cognitive and learning disabilities to solve potential and
    existing problems. Groups should have people with learning and cognitive
    disabilities in mind when working on security and risk mitigation.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, many people who cannot copy and paste passwords or use two-step
    authorization codes ask a caregiver to help them. As caregivers are often
    just temporary employees, this leaves the user exposed. Making passwords
    longer or requiring users change them regularly increases these unsafe
    practices and can actually make the application less secure. This type of
    design error is common when people with
    <a>cognitive and learning disabilities</a> are left out of the user research
    and analysis.
