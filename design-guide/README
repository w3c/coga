# Design Guide Files

These file are shared between the content-usable TR note (here) and the WAI website Design Guide (wai-coga-design-guide).

## Content-usable use

The files are included in `content-usable/index.html` using respect's include feature.

Note: they can be converted from html to markdown for easier editing by the Taskforce as respec supports markdown

## WAI websit use

This repo is included as a git submodule in wai-coga-deign-guide in order to access these files. A script converts these files for the Jekyll build process.

## File names

- `about.md` - the Design guide about section in content-usable
- `o<n>-<name>` - each objective eg `o1-understandable.html`
- `o<n>P<nn>-name` - each pattern eg `o1p01-clear-purpose.html`

## File format

Each file contains 

- Section Title used in content-usable
- A presection that is ignored by content usable but converted to frontmatter for the web version Jekyll build process
- The content for the objective or pattern

## Front matter in <pre>

Full details of how these are used can be found wai-coga-design-guide repo. But in brief the sections are

- title
- summary - objectives only - copied from the Summary section of content-usable
- ref - ref taken from the filename prefix, eg 01p01
- github - repo and file details
- sidebar - links to appear in the sidebar - eg user stories and personas
