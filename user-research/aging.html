	<h4>Aging and Dementia</h4>
	<p>The Aging and Dementia Gap Analysis focuses on issues and techniques for improving inclusion and quality of life for people with dementia using ICT. Our strategy includes a key ambition to develop ICT techniques that will work better for people affected by dementia; and to define, develop and improve dementia and aging-friendly ICT.</p>
	<p>Many people are able to age in good health and remain active participants in society throughout their lives. Others experience physical and cognitive limitations, and may lose the ability to live independently. Although dementia mainly affects older people, it is not a normal part of aging.</p>
	<p>The most elder-rich period of human history is upon us. How we regard and make use of this windfall of elders will define the world in which we live.</p>
	<p>There is a good phrase to remember regarding people with dementia: "If you've met one person with dementia, you've met one person with dementia". This has been largely attributed to the late Tom Kitwood, although no direct source has been found.</p>

		<h5>Description of Aging and Cognitive Decline</h5>
		<p>From Miriam Webster's Dictionary, the definition of aging is: Gradual change in an organism that leads to increased risk of weakness, disease, and death. It takes place in a cell, an organ, or the total organism over the entire adult-life span of any living thing. There is a decline in biological functions and inability to adapt to metabolic stress. Changes in organs include the replacement of functional cardiovascular cells with fibrous tissue. Overall effects of aging include reduced immunity; loss of muscle strength; decline in memory and other aspects of cognition; and loss of hair color and elasticity in the skin. In women, the process accelerates after menopause.</p>
		<p>Aging definition: an age-dependent or age-progressive decline in intrinsic physiological function, leading to an increase in age-specific mortality rate (i.e., a decrease in survival rate), and a decrease in age-specific reproductive rate. (7) To sum it up, aging is a complex process composed of several features: 1) an exponential increase in mortality with age; 2) physiological changes that typically lead to a functional decline with age; and 3) increased susceptibility to certain diseases with age. So, the aging process can be defined as a progressive deterioration of physiological function, an intrinsic age-related process of loss of viability, and an increase in vulnerability. (8)</p>

		<h5>Description of Dementia and Cognitive Decline</h5>
		<p>Dementia is defined as a severe loss of cognitive abilities that disrupts daily life. Symptoms include memory loss; mood changes; visual perception; focus challenges; and problems with communicating, decision making, and reasoning. Dementia is not a normal part of growing old. It is caused by diseases of the brain, the most common being Alzheimer's. Dementia is progressive, which means the symptoms will gradually get worse.</p>
		<section>
			<h6>Description of Alzheimer's</h6>
			<p>Alzheimer's disease (62% of those with dementia): A physical disease caused by changes in the structure of the brain and a shortage of important chemicals that help with the transmission of messages. In short, Alzheimer's is a brain disease that causes a slow decline in memory, thinking and reasoning skills.</p>
			<p><span class="todo">Statistics are from 2013 UK Study. Need to map with WHO and others.</span></p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h6>Description of Less Common (Non-Alzheimer's)</h6>
			<p>Set of non-Alzheimer's Dementia diseases:</p>
			<ul>
				<li> Vascular Dementia (17%): Caused by problems in the supply of blood to the brain, commonly caused by a stroke or a series of small strokes. </li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li> Mixed Dementia (10%): A type of dementia where a person has a diagnosis of both Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. </li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li> Dementia with Lewy bodies (4%): One of the less-common forms of dementia, it is caused by irregularities in brain cells, leading to symptoms similar to Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. </li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li> Rarer causes of Dementia (3%): There are many rarer causes of diseases and syndromes that can lead to dementia or dementia-like symptoms, including Corticobasal degeneration and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. </li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li> Fronto-temporal Dementia (2%): Rare when all ages are taken into account, but relatively common in people under 65, it is a physical disease that affects the brain. </li>
			</ul>

			<h6>Cognitive-Function Decline Due to Dementia</h6>
			<p><b>Overview</b>: The parts of the brain and cognitive functions affected depend upon the type of dementia.</p>
			<section>
				<h6>Alzheimer's</h6>
				<p>Alzheimer's: Specific Causes are being researched, but scientists note a buildup of two abnormal proteins (amyloid and tau), which damage nerve cells in the brain. The proteins form different types of clumps, plaques or tangles, which interfere with how brain cells work and communicate with each other. Plaques are usually first seen in the area of the brain that makes new memories (the hippocampus of the medial temporal lobe), but then moves to other parts of the brain as the disease progresses.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h6>Auditory Discrimination</h6>
				<p>Whenever the temporal part of the brain becomes diseased, people with dementia have difficulty making sense of sounds. They may lose the ability to follow conversations or become abnormally sensitive to sound. People can also become uncertain about the location of sounds. Social situations and music may be more difficult to enjoy.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h6>Visual Recognition Skills</h6>
				<p>In Posterior Cortical Atrophy, a rare form of Alzheimer's, the parietal and occipital lobes of the brain are affected by the same abnormal proteins found in Alzheimer's. This causes difficulty in seeing where and what things are.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h6>Phoneme Processing</h6>
				<p>In fronto-temporal dementia, the temporal lobe is affected, causing difficulty with speech and language.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h6>Cross-modal Association</h6>
				<p>People with Alzheimer's disease have a buildup of abnormal proteins in the hippocampus, which causes it to malfunction. This affects the ability to recognize places. They may become disoriented.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h6>Working Memory</h6>
				<p>In Alzheimer's disease, the buildup of abnormal proteins in the Hippocampus affects the ability to store new memories.</p>
				<p>When the temporal lobe is affected by fronto-temporal dementia, it causes difficulty in recollection of factual information.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h6>Behavioral</h6>
				<p>Fronto-temporal dementia is thought to be caused by proteins building up in the frontal lobe of the brain. People often experience changes in personality and behave inappropriately.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h6>Physical</h6>
				<p>In corticobasal degeneration, the cortex and basal ganglia become damaged, which is currently thought to occur due to the overproduction of the tau protein. This causes movement to be stiff or jerky, and affects one or more limbs.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h6>Consciousness</h6>
				<p>Dementia with Lewy bodies affects the cerebrum where small round lumps of proteins build up, and can cause fluctuations of consciousness, as well as hallucinations, delusions (firmly held beliefs in things that are not real), and false ideas (such as paranoia).</p>

			<h6>Typical behaviors exhibited by people with Dementia</h6>
			<ol>
				<li> Repetitive Behavior - Asking the same question over and over again. As well as memory loss, this can be due to the people's feelings of insecurity, or anxiety about their ability to cope.
                    <ol>
                        <li>Repetitive phrases or movements - This can be due to noisy or stressful surroundings; or boredom. It can also be a sign of discomfort, e.g., too hot or cold.</li>
                <li> Repetitive actions - Actions, such as repeatedly packing and unpacking a bag, or rearranging chairs in a room, may relate to a former activity. </li>
                        <li> Repeatedly asking to go home - This can be a sign of anxiety, insecurity, fear, or depression. The concept of 'home' might evoke memories of a time or place of comfort and safety. People may not recognize their present environment as their home, even if it is the place where they live. </li>
                        <li> Multiple phone calls - Some people with dementia phone their loved ones over and over again, particularly in the middle of the night. They may forget they have already called; or may be insecure or anxious. </li>
                    </ol>
				</li>
				<li> Restlessness <ol>
						<li> Pacing up and down - Pacing may indicate a desire to use the toilet, but an inability to say that. Alternatively, pacing may indicate a feeling of frustration, and wanting some fresh air. </li>
						<li> Fidgeting - Someone with dementia may fidget constantly. </li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li> Shouting and Screaming <ol>
						<li> People may continually call out for someone; shout the same word; or scream or wail over and over again. They could be experiencing difficulties with visual perception or hallucinations.</li>
					<li> People with dementia may feel lonely or distressed. If their short term memory is damaged, they may not remember that someone is in the next room, and believe they are alone. They may feel anxious about their failing memory; bored; or stressed by too-much noise and bustle. </li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li> Lack of inhibition <ol>
						<li> Some people with dementia may undress in public, having forgotten when and where it is appropriate to remove their clothes. </li>
						<li> Apparently-inappropriate sexual behavior may be a result of the physical damage to the part of the brain that allows recognition of acceptable social behaviors. </li>
						<li> Some actions, such as lifting a skirt or fiddling with flies, may simply be a sign that the person wants to use the toilet. </li>
						<li> The person may behave rudely, for example, by insulting people, by swearing, or by spitting. </li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li> Night-time Waking <ol>
						<li> Many people with dementia are restless at night, and find it difficult to sleep. Older people often need less sleep than younger people in any case. Dementia can affect people's body clocks. They may get up in the night, get dressed, or even go outside. </li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li> Trailing and Checking <ol>
						<li> Living with dementia makes many people feel extremely insecure and anxious. This can result in constantly following their carers or loved ones around, or calling out to check where they are. A few moments may seem like hours to a person with dementia. They may feel safe only if other people are nearby. </li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li> Hiding and Losing things <ol>
						<li> People with dementia sometimes hide things and then forget where they are, or forget they have hidden them at all. The wish to hide things may be due to feelings of insecurity, and a desire to hold on to what little they still have. </li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li> Suspicion <ol>
						<li> Some people with dementia can become suspicious. If they have mislaid an object, they may accuse someone of stealing it, or they may imagine that a friendly neighbor is plotting against them. These ideas may be due to failing memory, or an inability to recognize people, </li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li> Sleeplessness and ‘sundowning' <ol>
						<li> Many people with dementia, especially in the middle stages, experience periods of increased confusion at dusk, with their disorientation continuing throughout the night. These periods, of what is known as 'sundowning', usually diminish as dementia progresses. (1) </li>

To extend this further, people may have entirely forgotten what the computer is for, or where to find it. In this instance, the task becomes impossible until their memory returns. Secondly, some power buttons can be quite small. This may be difficult for those with reduced dexterity, particularly for those who are older, and may have arthritis or a tremor.</p>

				<li> "I have great difficulty remembering things, working things out, and interpreting things. I use a Dictaphone, which helps considerably. I can't use a normal watch so I've gone digital, but that has its limitations. I can't read very well so I use audio books. I can't count money, but I haven't found a way around that yet, so any suggestions will be gratefully received! So, I've developed strategies to help. These can be very simple but effective if they work. Often, it is the simplest things that get the better of us - things we have done all our lives without a problem. But now, because we can't do them, it is very frustrating." - Extract from a speech by Ann Johnson at the Uk Dementia Congress, November, 2010. </li>

		</ol>
		<p>(Conclusions from The 14th international conference ICCHP 2014 - see below.)</p>
		<section>
			<h6>Summary of Existing Research and Guidelines - Research Sources</h6>
			<p>Key features from Phiriyapkanon:</p>
			<ol>
				<li> Reduction of complexity: Factions that are rarely used, or are not necessary, should be removed. </li>
				<li> Clear structure of task: The starting points of tasks and every step should be easily recognized and understood. </li>
				<li> Consistency of information: Avoid contradictions and inconsistencies of information arraignment. </li>
				<li> Rapid and direct feedback: Applications should continuously provide easily-recognizable feedback of success or failure with every action. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>They also should minimize errors; and provide on-screen help and high recover-ability. <cite> Phiriyapkanon. Is big button interface enough for elderly users, P34, Malardardalen University Press Sweden 2011</cite>.</p>
			<p>K Dobsz et. al. recommends:</p>
			<ol>
				<li> strong contrast of images with content; </li>
				<li> simple and large graphics; </li>
				<li> sound conformation of accepted and rejected operations; </li>
				<li> automatic-voicing reading tasks (instructions). </li>
			</ol>

			<p>Key features from other guidelines:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>To help with difficulties in completing complex tasks, waiting until the elder completes one task before proceeding to the next step. </li>
				<li>Place tasks in step-by-step order.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Balance this because too-many steps can give a feeling of getting lost.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>One has to be consistent in naming steps, such as naming all steps beginning with a verb (such as "press the button"). </li>
				<li><b>Orientation</b> impairments cause elderly to unlearn how to find their way in new surroundings. Therefore: <ol>
						<li>Menus and usability interfaces need to be simplified to minimize the amount of information that needs to be memorized. </li>
						<li>An application should work independent of other applications. </li>
						<li>The screen should not have distracting elements (wallpaper, buttons etc.). </li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Information should be broken down into discreet chunks that the elderly can absorb. </li>
				<li>Content and information need to be consistent. </li>
				<li>Avoid stress that will further impair cognitive function. </li>
			</ol>

			<p> Key features for using tablets for the elderly from Dahn et. al.:</p>
			<ol>
				<li> The user interface should use widgets or large buttons rather then standard apps. Moving between screens should be possible using tabs or buttons, and not just gestures. </li>
				<li>Dedicated user interfaces often fall short of user requirements. Instead, populate the tablet with standard apps that have simple interfaces. </li>
				<li>Offer a PC-like mode with "file explorer" and familiar PC-interface features. </li>
				<li>Supply a printed manual. </li>
				<li>Privacy policies should be transparent to build trust. </li>
				<li>Supply a scaffolding approach to help and support, but allow flexible-entry points. </li>

			<h6>Prevalence of Aging</h6>
			<ul>
				<li> World Health Organization: 2012 Study <ul>
						<li> The world population is rapidly aging. <ul>
								<li> Between 2000 and 2050, the proportion of the world's population over 60 years old will double, from about 11% to 22%. The number of people aged 60 years and over is expected to increase from 605 million to 2 billion over the same period. </li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li> The number of people aged 80 and older will quadruple in the period 2000 to 2050. <ul>
								<li> By 2050, the world will have almost 400 million people aged 80 years or older. </li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li> By 2050, 80% of older people will live in low- and middle-income countries. </li>
						<li> The main health burdens for older people are from non-communicable diseases, while the greatest causes of disability are visual impairment, dementia, hearing loss, and osteoarthritis. </li>
						<li> Older people in low- and middle-income countries carry a greater disease burden than those in the rich world. </li>
						<li> The need for long-term care is rising. <ul>
								<li> The number of older people, who are no longer able to look after themselves, is forecast to quadruple by 2050 in developing countries. </li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li> Effective, community-level primary health care for older people is crucial. </li>
						<li> Supportive, "age-friendly" environments enable older people to live fuller lives, and maximize the contribution they make. <ul>
								<li> Creating "age-friendly" physical and social environments can have a big impact on improving the active participation and independence of older people. </li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li> Healthy aging starts with healthy behaviors in earlier stages of life. </li>
						<li> We need to reinvent our assumptions of old age. <ul>
								<li> Society needs to break stereotypes and develop new models of aging for the 21st century. Everyone benefits from communities, workplaces, and societies that encourage active and visible participation of older people. </li>

			<p><b>Abstract.</b> A literature review of papers that have explored digital-technology. user-interface design for people with dementia is reported. Only papers that have employed target user input directly, or from other works, have been included. Twenty four were analyzed. Improvements in reporting of studies are recommended. A case is made for considering the population of people with dementia as so heterogeneous that one design does not suit all. This is illustrated through some case-study reports from people with dementia. Furthermore, it is proposed that, by grouping people into functionally-similar sub-groups, interfaces may be designed for these groups that will collectively establish a sequence of 'stepping stone' interfaces that better address appropriate functioning and maintain self-efficacy. Fundamentally, people living with dementia are unique individuals with unique specific needs. A priori, in life experiences, interests, willingness to learn, environmental
				factors, and co-morbidities, they are as varied as any of their age peers. One thing they do not share with those peers is the degenerative consequences of the specific dementia they have. The progression of their disease also follows a unique time line, even if the general symptoms (and thus perhaps functional ability) change in a fairly predictable order. In the face of these statements, it might be inferred that it is most likely people with dementia require individual but adaptive (to progression of the disease), bespoke solutions for sustained independent living.</p>
			<p>Given the breadth of individuality in people, the effects of dementias, and indeed their progression, it is impossible to view them as a single, homogeneous population in terms of specifying a single user interface. In consequence, rather than simply designing for all people living with dementia, it is suggested that design for populations at stages of functional ability be investigated. Methods that set out to identify shared and bespoke requirements are needed to systematically establish any generalization. Currently, studies on design of digital AT, and indeed other ICT for people living with dementia, need to report much-more detail on: describing their participants; details of user interface features that worked well; and how much and what form carers' help took. More attention also needs to compare strategies and features that work to identify those that are best; or at least best for specific functional ability or tasks.</p>

				<p><b>Abstract.</b> The design of user interfaces for people with dementia does not appear, from the literature, to take into account the concomitant language and communication deficits when choosing the language used in the interfaces. A systematic approach was used to search databases for studies relating to language and communication in the four most-common forms of dementia (Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, fronto-temporal dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies). Studies identified were used as a basis for the commentary in this paper. Communication deficits are common in dementia. From the earliest stages of the disease, the person with dementia's capacity for communication declines as difficulties emerge with all aspects of language and functional communication. These deficits have implications for the successful interaction with assistive digital technology designed to improve the quality of life of people with dementia. More consideration should be given at
					the design stages to the potential impact of communication difficulties on interaction with technology.</p>
				<p>It is important to note that the authors have not been able to find, to date, any conclusions about what impact these impairments may have on user interface design.</p>
				<p>The results of this review have highlighted areas of strength (reading) and areas of difficulty (spoken-language output and understanding some aspects of spoken and written language) in the communication abilities of people living with dementia. Those who design interfaces for this client group should consider the impact that their language and communication choices might have on end-users with dementia. In particular, the following general guidelines should be taken into account, in order to maximize the accessibility of the language of interfaces for people with dementia.</p>
