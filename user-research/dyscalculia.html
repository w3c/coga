	<h4>Dyscalculia</h4>
	<p>Dyscalculia is a learning disability specifically-related to mathematics. People with dyscalculia have significant problems with numbers and mathematical concepts, but still have a normal or above-normal IQ. Few people with dyscalculia have problems with math alone. Many also struggle with problems being able to learn to tell time, left/right orientation, rules in games, and much more.</p>
	<p>Researchers have yet to come to a final conclusion with just how many types of dyscalculia exist. David Geary has broken the disability down into 4 main areas: semantic-retrieval dyscalculia; procedural dyscalculia; visuospatial dyscalculia; and number-fact dyscalculia. [[Geary-1]]</p>
	<p>It should be noted that this is the opinion of just one researcher. There are many other well-established categories for dyscalculia. One such example is published in the Journal of Learning Disabilities, and has arisen from the research of Kosc Ladislav. He has broken Developmental Dyscalculia into 6 areas: verbal, practognostic, lexical, graphical, ideognostical, and operational-developmental. [[Ladislav-1]]</p>
	<p>Diana Laurillard (Professor of Learning with Digital Technologies at the Institute of Education, London) - "Although they [individuals with dyscalculia] can count, they do not see the relationships between numbers - e.g., that 5 is made up of 2 and 3. For them, it is just a sequence, like the alphabet. We do not see E as made up of B and C, because it's not. It's just later in the sequence."</p>
	<p>The UK DfES (Department for Education &amp; Skills) described dyscalculia in its National Numeracy Strategy:</p>
	<p>"Dyscalculia is a condition that affects the ability to acquire arithmetical skills. Dyscalculic learners may have difficulty understanding simple number concepts, lack an intuitive grasp of numbers, and have problems learning number facts and procedures. Even if they produce a correct answer or use a correct method, they may do so mechanically and without confidence."</p>
	<section>
		<h5>Cognitive Functions</h5>
		<p>Genetic, neurobiological, and epidemiologic evidence indicates that dyscalculia, like other learning disabilities, is a brain-based disorder. Some research suggests it may be the result of an altered neural substrate.</p>
		<p>It has also been suggested that poor teaching and environmental deprivation may compound the condition [[Shalev-1]].</p>
		<p>Because the neural network of both hemispheres comprises the substrate of normal arithmetic skills, dyscalculia can result from dysfunction of either hemisphere, although the left parietotemporal area is of particular significance according to UCL Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience. The debate as to whether the left or right parietotemporal area is linked with dyscalculia is hotly contested. However, there is more research pointing towards a fault in the left parietotemporal area.</p>
		<p>There is some research to suggest that dyscalculia may occur as a consequence of prematurity and low birth weight, and is frequently encountered along with a variety of other neurological disorders, such as: attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), developmental-language disorder, epilepsy, and Fragile X Syndrome. Developmental dyscalculia has proven to be a persistent learning disability, at least for the short term, in about half of affected preteen pupils [[Butterworth-1]]. Dyscalculia can also occur later in life as a result of a brain lesion or other traumatic brain injury.</p>

		<h5>Symptoms</h5>
		<p>Common symptoms include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>normal/accelerated language acquisition (Good visual memory for the printed word. Good in areas of science, geometry and creative arts until a level of higher math skill is required, and where figures use logic not formula); </li>
			<li>mistaken recollection of names (Poor name/face retrieval); </li>
			<li>difficulty with abstract context of time and direction; </li>
			<li>poor mental math ability; </li>
			<li>mistakes commonly made when manipulating numbers; </li>
			<li>inability to grasp and remember math concepts; </li>
			<li>inability to comprehend or 'picture' mechanical processes; </li>
			<li>poor memory of the layout of things; </li>
			<li>poor sense of direction; </li>
			<li>difficulty grasping concepts of formal music education; </li>
			<li>struggles with spatial orientation; </li>
			<li>poor athletic coordination; </li>
			<li>difficulty when playing games. </li>
		</ul>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h5>Their Challenges</h5>
		<p><b>Memory:</b> Poor long-term memory, resulting in an inability to remember names (despite recognizing faces). Inability to recall schedules or sequences, e.g., dance steps and musical-instrument fingering. Unable to remember rules in sports and other games, such as card games. Difficulty remembering whose turn it is.</p>
		<p><b>Numbers:</b> Difficulty with numbers, specifically in cases of addition, subtraction, omission, reversal, and transposition. Inability to count, especially when asked to begin counting at a number other than 1. Particular difficulty with numbers with zeros and their relationships to each other, such as 10, 100, 1000.</p>
		<p><b>Abstract Concepts:</b> Poor concept mastery, resulting in an inability to grasp math concepts. Lack of ability for visualization, such as numbers on a clock face; and recognizing geographical locations and where they are in relation to these locations. Limited capability for strategic planning, such as in chess. Difficulties with spatial orientation, such as distinguishing left from right and north, south, east, and west. Inability to grasp the concept of time or direction, frequently lost/late, trouble telling time. Difficulty handling money. (Many adults with dyscalculia find themselves overdrawn as a result of this.) Difficulty in planning for long term with a tendency to focus on the present or the near future.</p>
		<p><b>Coordination:</b> Poor athletic coordination, resulting in difficulty keeping up with rapidly-changing physical directions.</p>
		<p><b>The inability to grasp abstract concepts translates to more practical situations.</b></p>
		<p><b>Financial Planning:</b> Due to the combination of the inability to grasp the concept of money and poor long term memory, financial planning is particularly challenging for people with dyscalculia. The actual value of products means very little. People with dyscalculia can also struggle with purchasing the correct quantities. For example, when buying food at the supermarket, often far too much or too little is bought. When change is given in shops, few people with dyscalculia are able to correctly calculate how much money they have and how much they should have been given back. As a result of all of this, many people with dyscalculia are consistently overdrawn, and rely heavily on others for help.</p>
		<p><b>Currency:</b> Following on from the inability to grasp the concept of money, foreign currency is particularly difficult to comprehend, especially as exchange rates are often changing, and calculations are often involved when trying to convert one currency to another.</p>
		<p><b>Temperature:</b> Temperature is meaningless when told in numbers, especially when both Celsius and Fahrenheit are used.</p>
		<p><b>Traveling:</b> Few people with dyscalculia learn to drive as driving is heavily reliant upon numbers (speed limits, petrol gauge, distances, etc.). This means many must rely upon buses and trains for transport. Getting the right bus/train at the right time, and on the correct platform, are huge problems because each involves the use of numbers and time.</p>

		<h5>Some Personas With Use Case that Address Key Challenges</h5>
		<section>
			<h6>Booking a Train Ticket Online</h6>
			<p>Scenario A "Jenny" is a person with dyscalculia. She is a mother with two young children. She is trying to book train tickets online for herself and her children. The train journey involves one change where she must walk to a different platform. She must also ensure her first train arrives at the change destination with enough time for her to find the correct platform before the train sets off for the second part of her journey. She needs to be able to book the tickets for the correct time, and with the appropriate rail card, to be able to qualify for discounts. She also needs to be able to remember her password for her bank's security system so she can purchase the tickets. This password is made up of a combination of letters and numbers to fulfill the bank's 'secure-password' criteria.</p>

						<td>This step is particularly difficult as it requires the entry of a date and a time for travel. People with dyscalculia have a limited ability to grasp the concept of time. Therefore, they may struggle to work out when their train journey is, and also how far away the date and time of their journey is from the current date and time. </td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Select number of adult &amp; child passengers. </td>

						<td>In this step, the only challenge is the selection of the time of the journey. As mentioned above, people with dyscalculia struggle with the concept of time. Therefore, they may be liable to selecting a return journey that occurs before the outward journey. Fortunately, most if not all online train-ticket applications will not allow the transaction to proceed if this is the case. The error will be flagged in red. </td>

						<td>This is not directly an issue at the point of purchase. However, collecting tickets from a self-service ticket machine can be very difficult for people with dyscalculia. The ticket-collection reference number used to validate the purchase is made up of an entirely random mix of numbers; and upper &amp; lower case letters. It would be almost impossible to commit this reference number to memory, or to find a pattern in it. Therefore, it must copied out, which gives rise to sequencing issues resulting in the numbers being inputted in the wrong order. The whole process could take a very long time. </td>

					<tr>
						<td>Enter card details (number, expiration date, name, security code). </td>
						<td>Although this step does involve numbers, it does not require any manipulation of numbers, such as addition, subtraction, etc.. Therefore, the act of typing the numbers from the card into the website should be achievable. However, some people may struggle with sequencing and end up typing the numbers out of order. </td>

						<td>This step is likely to prove most difficult as it requires the use of long-term memory (LTM), which may be fairly limited in people with dyscalculia. Also, the customer is required to enter a password out of its usual order. For example, the customer may be asked to enter the 3rd, 5th, and 7th characters in the password. As people with dyscalculia struggle with the concept of numbers and sequences, this step may be achievable only by having the password written down in front of them. However, this then reduces the security of their payment method. </td>

			<h6>Using Online Banking to Pay Someone New</h6>
			<p>Scenario B "Emily" is a high-school student who struggles to understand many of the topics covered in her math, science, and music lessons. She needs to use her online-banking account to transfer some money into a friend's bank account. She hasn't transferred money online to this friend before, so she must set up a new user. This requires using a card reader; and typing in a code that appears on the card reader only for 30 seconds before it changes to increase security.</p>

						</td>
						<td>This requires users to access their LTM to remember the password, and then be able to count up each of the numbers/letters to enter the correct characters out of their normal pattern. Counting is hard for people with dyscalculia, especially when it doesn't begin at 1, which increases the difficulty of these 2 tasks. </td>

					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Select 'pay someone new'. </td>

						</td>
						<td>This task is likely to be the most challenging of the transaction due to time constraints that are in place for security reasons. Firstly, users must type their pin number into the card reader, which requires the use of LTM. However, this can be achieved as often people with dyscalculia are able to remember their pin number as a pattern. Then the user must enter the numbers on the computer screen into the card reader. This shouldn't be too difficult because it requires only copying the numbers. The user must then enter numbers, which appear on the screen of the card reader, into a text box on the website. This stage is fairly difficult because the numbers on the card reader change every 30 seconds to increase security. Therefore, the numbers must be typed in fairly quickly. Also, many people with dyscalculia struggle to understand the concept of time. Therefore, they may find it difficult to work out quite how quickly they must enter the numbers before they change. </td>

			<h6>Online Shopping</h6>
			<p>Whilst people with dyscalculia may find it relatively simple to set up an online shopping account, it is far harder to complete the actual task of shopping. This stems from the inability to grasp the concept of money, and the amount a product costs, in relation to the amount of money they might have in their bank account. As a result of this, people with dyscalculia frequently find themselves overdrawn. The task of calculating numbers to produce a final figure, which has some meaning to them as opposed to being a collection of random numbers, is a concept they cannot master. This often leads to active avoidance of the task, or strong reliability on others, neither of which is a sustainable solution. Quantities are also an abstract concept. People with dyscalculia often buying far too much or not-nearly enough because it is difficult for them to work out exactly how much they need. Anything that involves weights and measures, e.g. 1 kg of potatoes, is also almost impossible to understand.</p>

	</section>
	<section>
		<h5>Summary of Existing Research and Guidelines</h5>
		<p>It is widely acknowledged that dyscalculia was first discovered in 1919 by Salomon Henschen, a Swedish neurologist who found that it was possible for a person of high general intelligence to have impaired mathematical abilities. At the time, it was known as 'number blindness'. The term 'dyscalculia' was later coined by Dr. Josef Gerstman in the 1940s. When compared with dyslexia and other similar learning disabilities, dyscalculia receives relatively little recognition. There is still limited awareness of its existence.</p>
		<p>Although there are many classifications of dyscalculia, it can be broken down into 3 sections; developmental dyscalculia (inherited/acquired during prenatal or early developmental period); post-lesion dyscalculia (acquired during an incident of traumatic brain injury affecting specific areas of the brain); and pseudo-dyscalculia (a result of inadequate instruction).</p>
		<p>Formal definition: The Department for Education Skills (DfES) defines dyscalculia as: "A condition that affects the ability to acquire arithmetical skills. Dyscalculic learners may have difficulty understanding simple number concepts; lack an intuitive grasp of numbers; and have problems learning number facts and procedures. Even if they produce a correct answer or use a correct method, they may do so mechanically and without confidence."</p>
		<section>
			<h6>Etiology</h6>
			<p>Adult neuropsychological and neuroimaging research points to the intraparietal sulcus as a key region for the representation and processing of numerical magnitude [[Price-1]]. This raises the possibility of a parietal dysfunction as a root cause of dyscalculia [[Price-1]]. The following two studies support this research.</p>
			<p>Virtual Dyscalculia Induced by Parietal-Lobe TMS Impairs Automatic Magnitude Processing</p>
			<p>UCL scientists state that dyscalculia is a result of a malformation in the right-parietal lobe in the brain. However, the underlying dysfunction is relatively unknown (c.07). The study involved using neuronavigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to stimulate the brain and cause dyscalculia, only for a few hundred milliseconds, in typical individuals. The subjects then completed math tasks whilst under stimulation, and produced dyscalculia-like behavior. However, when the left-parietal lobe was stimulated under TMS, this behavior was not observed. Therefore, it can be reasonably assumed there is a causal relationship between defects in the right-parietal lobe and dyscalculia. [[Cohen-Kadosh-1]]</p>
			<p>The above research is supported by the following research study: Impaired parietal magnitude processing in developmental dyscalculia. This study was conducted by Gavin R. Price, Ian Holloway, Pekka Räsänen, Manu Vesterinen and Daniel Ansari. It shows that, in children with developmental dyscalculia, the right-intraparietal sulcus is not modulated in response to numerical processing demands to the same degree as in typically-developing children. This suggests a causal relationship between impairment of parietal-magnitude systems and developmental dyscalculia. [[Price-1]]</p>
			<p>Research by Shalev, et. al. suggests some families have a genetic predisposition to dyscalculia, resulting in prevalence 10x higher than in the general population. [[Shalev-2]] Although dyscalculia cannot be cured, it is hoped early detection and remedial teaching can go a long way to reducing the effects of dyscalculia on the individual.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h6>Comorbidity</h6>
			<p>High comorbidity with ADHD (estimates range between 15-26%) and dyslexia (estimates range between 17-64%) [[Wilson-1]]. There is strong evidence to suggest Turners Syndrome and Gerstmann's Syndrome are associated with dyscalculia. [[Bruandet-1]]</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h6>Guidelines</h6>
			<p>Although there are no specific guidelines produced by a governing body, there are several ways to help individuals with dyscalculia improve their mathematical abilities.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>study sheets/summary sheets/outlines of most important facts;</li>
				<li>supplementary aids (vocabulary, multiplication cards, etc.);</li>
				<li>visual demonstrations;</li>
				<li>instructions/directions given in different channels (written, spoken, demonstration);</li>
				<li>visual or multi-sensory materials;</li>
				<li>mnemonic aids/devices.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Some more-useful guidelines regarding dyscalculia, specifically for school children, are available from Leeds City Council (PDF): <a class="external text" href="http://www.leeds.gov.uk/docs/Dyscalculia%20Guidelines%20April%202013.pdf">Guidelines for Specific Learning Difficulties in Maths/Dyscalculia</a>.</p>
			<p>Dyscalculia is still a relatively-unknown disability with many of those affected by it not being diagnosed until later in life. Often, with children in schools especially, those affected are thought to be stupid or lazy because many people are unaware of dyscalculia's existence. This is analogous to the treatment of people with dyslexia.</p>

		<h5>Potentials and Possibilities</h5>
		<p class="todo">Add ideas for filling gaps. </p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h5>Prevalence</h5>
		<p>Studies conducted by Gross-Tsur, Manor and Shalev in 1996 suggest that 6.5% of the population have dyscalculia. Conflicting research done by Lewis, Hitch and Walker in 1994 suggests that 1.3% of the population have dyscalculia, while 2.3% have dyscalculia and dyslexia. This puts the world population of people with dyscalculia at 3.6%. (8)</p>
		<p>5-6% in school age children. [[Shalev-1]]</p>
		<p>This gives the rough estimate that between 3½ and 6½% of the world population is affected by dyscalculia. However, no international study has been done on how common it is.</p>
		<p>Studies show the presentation of dyscalculia in males and females is roughly equal. Neither gender appears to have a greater predisposition than the other. [[Shalev-1]]</p>
