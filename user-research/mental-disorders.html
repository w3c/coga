	<h4>Mental Disorders</h4>
  <section><h5>Introduction</h5>
	<p>This user research is based on findings from a comprehensive systematic literature review that was carried out by the BETTER Project&nbsp;to identify the challenges people with mental disorders encounter when using the Web and any measures to remove or reduce these barriers. 11 of the included studies considered more than one mental disorder and 2 investigated a single disorder each. Therefore, challenges and recommended measures to address them are discussed together here. Please see this publication for detailed information on the methods used.</p>
    <p>Findings identified challenges faced by people affected by 3 categories of mental disorders: (1) mood disorders, (2) anxiety and stress-related disorders, and (3) schizophrenia, schizoaffective and psychotic disorders. These disorders along with their associated symptoms, treatment and potential challenges on the Web will be discussed in more detail in the next sections focusing on this user group. </p>
    <p>All symptoms and limitations in functioning discussed below are based on internationally-accepted and evidence-based classifications. The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) is a comprehensive and universally-accepted framework to describe functioning, disability and health. The 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) is a medical classification list by the World Health Organization (WHO) that describes mental disorders, among other conditions. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) is another commonly used classification for mental disorders and is published by the American Psychiatric Association.</p>

    <h6>Motivations behind Web usage</h6>
    <p>The Web is often used as a source of support for people with mental disorders and shows great promise for the reduction of the burden associated with these disorders.</p>
    <p>People with mental disorders use the Web for several reasons:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Web-based information seeking is common among people with mental disorders [1, 2].</li>
      <li>Web-based mental health communities are known to supplement traditional mental health services [3] and act as an important factor in encouraging people with mental disorders to seek professional help [4]. </li>
      <li>Web-based treatment (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy) options are used as they may be as effective as the face-to-face equivalent for reducing depressive symptoms [5-7].</li></ul></section></section>
<section><h5>Mood/Affective disorders</h5>
    <section><h6>Introduction</h6>
    <p>Moods are essential to how people experience the world. Moods allow people to judge others and everyday situations, be alerted to threats, recognize opportunities and to convey one&rsquo;s feelings. The fallout when moods become disturbed is profound and accompanied by considerable distress.</p>
    <p>Mood disorders typically feature excessive and or persistent periods sadness, joyousness or both.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Depression is the term used to denote feelings of intense and enduring sadness.</li>
      <li>Bipolar refers to intense and enduring periods of joyousness.</li>
    </ul></section><section>
    <h6>Spectrum of associated symptoms and limitations in functioning</h6>
    <section><h7>Depression</h7>
    <p>Individuals affected by this disorder usually experience many of the below features:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>depressed mood</li>
      <li>loss of interest and enjoyment and reduced energy leading to increased fatiguability and diminished activity</li>
      <li>reduced concentration and attention</li>
      <li>reduced self-esteem and self-confidence</li>
      <li>ideas of guilt and unworthiness (even in a mild type of episode)</li>
      <li>bleak and pessimistic views of the future</li>
      <li>ideas or acts of self-harm or suicide</li>
      <li>disturbed sleep</li>
      <li>diminished appetite</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In addition to the internationally-accepted and evidence-based classifications discussed in the introduction, the ICF Core Set for depression was used to further describe functioning, disability and health in persons affected by this condition. This core set can be downloaded using the following link – <a href="https://www.icf-research-branch.org/download/send/9-mentalhealth/108-comprehensiveandbrieficfcoresetsdepression">https://www.icf-research-branch.org/download/send/9-mentalhealth/108-comprehensiveandbrieficfcoresetsdepression</a>.</p></section><section>
    <h7>Bipolar</h7>
    <p>Individuals affected by this disorder usually experience many of the below features:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Occasions of an elevation of mood and increased energy and activity (mania or hypomania).</li>
      <li>Occasions of a lowering of mood and decreased energy and activity (depression).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In addition to the internationally-accepted and evidence-based classifications discussed in the introduction, the ICF Core Set for bipolar disorders was used to further describe functioning, disability and health in persons affected by this condition. This core set can be downloaded using the following link – <a href="https://www.icf-research-branch.org/download/send/9-mentalhealth/123-brieficfcoresetforbipolardisorders">https://www.icf-research-branch.org/download/send/9-mentalhealth/123-brieficfcoresetforbipolardisorders</a>.</p></section></section><section>
    <h6>Potential challenges on the Web</h6>
    <p>Deficits in cognition have repercussions for general functioning which can affect how people with mood disorders use the Web in several ways.</p></section></section><section>
    <h5>Summary of Web accessibility barriers experienced by people with mental disorders</h5>
    <section><h6>Operable</h6>
    <p>Barriers reported by included studies are primarily related to poorly designed navigational elements (e.g., content filters), difficulties with fine motor coordination (e.g., clicking small radio buttons, operating computer mouse, scrolling), poorly designed pages with time limited response forms, too much information and unoptimised components that contribute to slow webpage loading times.</p></section>
   <section> <h6>Understandable</h6>
    <p>Included studies revealed barriers which included the use of complicated and excessive content, distracting and confusing design, and complex and overindulgent website functions (e.g., excessive advertising and complicated purchasing processes). Facilitation measures derived from empirical evidence heavily focus on increasing the clarity of website content by ensuring only necessary information is shared and provided at a low reading level with no abbreviations and unfamiliar phrasing.</p></section>
   <section><h6>Perceivable</h6>
     <p>Identified barriers point to difficulties with reading small font, recognising icons and locating information.</p></section></section>
</section><section>
     <h5>Summary of recommendations that improve Web accessibility for people with mental disorders</h5>
     <p>Facilitation measures recommended by studies were summarised into a group of 20 from 59 recommendations and are shown in Table 1. Table 1 does not list or arrange summarised recommendations in any particular order. Nine of the summarised recommendations were the result of empirical work and 11 from the expert opinion of researchers.</p>
