			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>This document is to help us gather techniques and strategies as we come across them, so that they do not get forgotten or are hard to find later when we are finished the gap analysis.</p>
			<p>Larger scale, engineering solutions can also be added to the issue papers.</p>
            
            <p>Editors Note: We intend to add more  examples to each technique and provide some example pages </p>
			<section>
			  <h3>Summary </h3>
			  <p>Most designers want people to be able to use their site. However designs that might be difficult for some people to use can actually bar people with cognitive and learning disabilities from using the content at all. Typically this happens because content providers may not be familiar with the needs of different people. </p>
			  <p>This document contains detailed techniques that should enable content to be usable by people with cognitive and learning disabilities. </p>
			  <p>We have identified the following <strong>themes</strong> though the techniques.</p>
			  <ol>
			    <li><strong>Help as many users as possible understand the site and  know how to use it.</strong> This often involves using things that are clear and familiar   to the user so that they do not have  to learn new symbols, terms or design patters. <strong>Personalization </strong>and good use of semantics can help make the  symbols and design as familiar to the user as possible.</li>
			    <li><strong>Prevent the user from making mistakes and make it easy to correct mistakes</strong> when they do occur. A good design and use of scripts will make errors less likely, but when they do occur the user should know how to correct them, without having to renter other data or start from the beginning.</li>
			    <li><strong>Help the use focus and   to restore context if attention is lost</strong>.  Items like  breadcrumbs can help orientate the user and help the user restore the context when it is lost. (Making breadcrumbs clickable can also help the user undo mistakes)</li>
		      </ol>
			  <p>&nbsp;</p>
			  <p>Main techniques include:</p>

            </section>
			<section><h3>Document structure</h3> The top level headings are who the techniques and strategies are for, such as general techniques that help most people with Cognitive and Learning Disabilities, techniques that help for attention, techniques that help people with difficulty processing language etc. The sections are based on function and not disability names. </p>
			<p>The document is the divided into topics (such as E<em>mphasis Structure</em>) at heading level 3, and then into individual techniques at heading level 4. Each topic also has a "see also" section where you can put WCAG mappings. Where appropriate the techniques can labeled for localization. </p>
			<p>Each technique is divided into: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Explanation and who it helps,</li>
				
			  <li> Pass examples, (if needed) </li>
				<li>Failure examples,(if needed) and </li>
				<li>Sources/research. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>Tags are for who it helps ("use for" tags) and for who can detriment ("avoid for" tags) from use of this strategy. The default is that a strategy is good for all groups.</p>
			<p>Tags can be for the cognitive function impairments or other user descriptors such as localization.</p>
			<p> For example </p>
			<p><strong>Use for:</strong> &quot;Short Term Memory" would imply that this strategy is helpful for people with a short term memory impairment.</p>
			<p>Tags can be concatenated. For example: "Short Term Memory-Visual Memory". Additional terms are limiting, and the tag becomes more specific as we concatenate terms.</p>
			<p>Tags for cognitive function are found in the Cognitive Function Table (link to be provided soon).</p>
			<p> Localization tags so far include: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Non-semitic languages and semitic languages (note these tags need more expansion for Chinese etc)</li>
				<li>Low context and high context cultures</li>
				<li>Familiarity with the Internet and web 2.0. Note this is often age related. Tags are: <ul>
						<li>Experienced Internet User: Uses Web 2.0 extensively, will use avatars and familiarizer with social media conventions.</li>
						<li> Intermediate Internet User: Knows how to use basic pages without thinking.</li>
						<li>Basic Internet user: Has learned about links and buttons.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Feel free to put in a technique even if you do not have all this information. However try to provide any research that you know of - even if it is just your own personal experience. If you add a localization category, please also add it to this introduction.</p></section>
			
			<section>
			<h3>Exemptions</h3>
      <p>The group feel the following situations can create exceptions to parts of techniques</p>
            <ul>
              <li>When techniques about writing styles detract from a key role of the text you can use a modified writing style guide instead. The modified writing style guide that the page conforms to, should be made public.  Examples include content where the main role is  artistic or literary (and not to pass on information, social, enable the user to complete a task or other role)</li>
              <li>If the main role of the text is artistic then use techniques about formatting styles when they do not detract from the main role of the content.</li>
              <li>If the main role of content is to evaluate the user's cognitive abilities, then use techniques as much as possible  when they do not detract from the main role of the content.</li>
            </ul>

		  <h2>General techniques </h2>
			<p>General techniques are useful for most people with Cognitive and Learning Disabilities</p>
			<section>
				<h3>Provide a clear structure </h3>
				<section>
					<h4>Break your content into manageable chunks</h4>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Identify 1-3 main tasks that covers most of what users want to do. Make sure it is obvious how to do them as soon as the content loads. </li>
						<li>Have one topic per page. </li>
						<li>Have one idea per paragraph. (One sentence is enough for a paragraph.) </li>
						<li>Have one point per sentences. Long sentences can often be broken up into short sentence or lists. If a sentence can use more then one conjuction or comer, it typically can be broken up.</li>
					</ul>
					<section>
						<h5>Explanation and who it helps:</h5>
						<p> This brakes the content into digestible pieces that the user can cope with. </p>

                <section>
				<h4>Help the user find information</h4>
                
                Having a clear path to content helps all users. Also note that personalization can be used to remove  extraneous information.
				<ul>
					<li><strong>When possible have no more than three clicks to get to information. </strong>Divide your pages into sections and subtopics. Try and ensure that it is clear what topic the page would be under. Ensure that it can be reached though any high level page that it logically could belong. Help and support should  be one click away</li>
					<li><strong>Provide different methods to find information. </strong>Provide a site map, and preferably a the search box as well. <br>
				  </li>
					<li><strong>Limit the number of links in each area</strong>. 
  Have no more then seven  links in any one navigation section or under any one subheading. </li>
    <li>Make clickable areas obvious, such as links and buttons</li></ul>
				    <section><h5>Explanation and who it helps: </h5>
				    <p>Some people can get overwhelmed by too much information and may give up when it takes too long to find information<br />

				<section>
					<h4>Use headings and labels to describe topic or purpose.</h4>
					<p>Simple colored headings with fonts two size larger than general content to aid navigation skills</p>
					<section>
						<h5>Explanation and who it helps:</h5>
						<p>This supports those who have reading and some visual perceptual difficulties due to Receptive Aphasia (Wernicke’s Aphasia) and acquired dyslexia as well as those with general cognitive learning disabilities, where long sentences and complex words can cause difficulties. [EDN1</p>

				  </section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Use consistent styles</h4>
					<p>Ensure:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>All headings with the same role have the same style,</li>
						<li>appearance of controls and menu items consistent in all areas,</li>
						<li>clarity of display on plain backgrounds,</li>
						<li>icons, controls and menus are used consistently across your site.</li>
					</ul>
					<section>
					  <h5>Explanation and who it helps: </h5>
						<p>This supports those who have reading and some visual perceptual difficulties due to Receptive Aphasia and acquired dyslexia as well as those with general cognitive learning disabilities. It also helps those with visual acuity difficulties where stroke and age related disabilities co-occur. </p>
					
					 
				  
					<p><strong> Use for tags: </strong>All<br /> Receptive Aphasia, acquired dyslexia, visual acuity difficulties<br />
							<strong>Avoid for tags: </strong></p>

					<h4>Use presentation, color and symbols to show structure and relationships</h4>
					<p>Ensure that </p>
					<ul>
						<li>icons, controls and menus are located in consistent and non- distracting areas.</li>
						<li>highlight key points in bold - (be careful not to over use, because it feels like shouting)</li>
						<li>text boxes to highlight important information</li>
					</ul>
					<section>
						<h5>Explanation and who it helps:</h5>

					<h4>Use lists and tables</h4>
					<p>Ensure that:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>bullet points are well spaced</li>
						<li>a minimal number of words are used (e.g.5)</li>
						<li>lists are not cluttered by surrounding items</li>
						<li>keywords start the statement such as “Stroke happens suddenly”</li>

					<h4>Use a clear presentation </h4>
					<ul>
					  <li>Identify the main task or information and keep it easy to find, e.g. to the top left where the eye goes first in English (consider localization for right to left languages such as Arabic). </li>
						<li>use visual grouping with subheading to enable filtering of content without overwhelming</li>
						<li>use white space and lines to define areas </li>
						<li>include an index or sitemap</li>

					<h3>Be predictable</h3>
					<p>The more predictable your content is the easier it is to know how to use it. </p>
					<ul>
						<li>Use a consistent layout for all your content</li>
						<li>Use the same icons and buttons to serve the same function</li>
						<li>Use the same linked text to go to the same page </li>
						<li>Use standard layout design, so it is easy to find common content. In 2015 in English sites this includes: <ul>
								<li>the search box is in the right hand corner</li>
								<li>a link to home page in the left hand corner</li>
								<li>site map in the footer, etc.</li>
							</ul>

			<h3>Writing style</h3>
			<section>
				<h4>Be clear and to the point</h4>
				<p>Making your   message clear. The first step is to identify what your main message is. Then ensure that: </p>
				<ul>
					<li>Extraneous information is separated (preferably removed)</li>
					<li>key points are separated out</li>
					<li>check that the order of statements is logical </li>
					<li>use short clear sentences (avoid multiple points in one sentence) </li>
					<li>choose words that are in general use ,and are easily understood by your audience</li>
					<li>avoid hyphenated words and acronyms (unless they are easily understandable)</li>
					<li>be factual</li>
					<li>use clear headings to signpost information</li>
					<li> use words that make it clear what will happen when links and buttons are used (such as &quot;search&quot; in place of &quot;submit&quot;)</li>
					<li>avoid the use of metaphors such as 'it's raining cats and dogs' as people may take these literally.</li>
				</ul>
			  <p>In cases where there is a lot of information provide a clear and simple summary of the content.</p>

				<h4>Give instructions clearly</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>use short clear sentences</li>
					<li>use simple, clear words </li>
					<li>do not miss out steps</li>
					<li>do not assume users can guess what you mean</li>
					<li>leave plenty of space between lines (at least 1.5 spacing between lines)</li>
					<li>use unambiguous language</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Note that many users find it easier if you limit decisions/options for user. However other users find it easier to see all related options at the same time. Providing a consistent &quot;more options&quot; mechanism can help. Personalization can also help address conflicting needs.</p>

				<h4>Use a simple tense and active rather than passive voice.</h4>
				<p>Simple present tense is usually easier to understand then other tenses</p>
				<p><strong>Example:</strong> "I am using the present tense"  as appose to &quot;the present tense  was used&quot;</p>
				<p>With  the <em>active voice,</em> the subject of sentence performs the action. Passive voice the subject receives the action. For example </p>
				<p><strong>Example - Active: </strong>Researchers <em>showed</em> that high stress <em>can cause</em> heart attacks.</p>
			  <p><strong>Example - Passive:</strong> High stress, has been proved by researchers to sometimes be the cause of heart attacks.</p>
			  <p>To identify passive voicing</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Check that it is clear who is  the subject of  the sentence </li>
					<li>The term "by" phrase often is used in passive voicing</li>
					<li>Possible use of ‘you’ but careful use of other pronouns such as ‘she’, ‘he’ etc ii</li>
					<li>Determiners such as ‘this’ and ‘that’ can confuse</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Exemption</p>
			  <p>There are times when passive voicing or other tense can be clearer.  In these cases, there is an exemption if active voicing has been shown in a user test to be harder to understand, less friendly or  inappropriate.</p>
				<p>For example: The sentence <em>&quot;You many not eat here&quot;</em> may be considered aggressive. <em>&quot;Eating is not allowed in this room&quot;</em> is just as clear and is less aggressive.</p>
				<section>
					<h5>Explanation and who it helps:</h5>
					<p>Those with Expressive Aphasia may ?and the use of passive voice “di?cult due to problems with retrieving the relevant grammatical morphemes” and those with receptive Aphasia may also find it hard to automatically understand the meaning of passive voice . This supports those who have Dementia and/or acquire cognitive disabilities as they Age. </p>

				<h4>Avoid double negatives.</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>It is important to avoid sentences that contain double negatives or dependent clauses for example <em>“</em><em>He doesn’t have nothing but the clothes on his back.”</em></li>
				</ul>
				<section>
					<h5>Explanation and who it helps:</h5>
					<p>These sentences tend to be grammatically incorrect and confusing – their use should be avoided for those who have intellectual disabilities, any type of Aphasia, specific learning difficulties as well as those with general cognitive learning disabilities. This supports those who have Dementia and/or acquire cognitive disabilities as they Age.</p>

				<h4>Checking Readability </h4>
				<p>Check long documents in sections to determine which parts are too hard to read. </p>
				<p>One way to do this is to use the Flesch Reading Ease score which rates text on a 100-point scale. The higher the score, the easier it is to understand the document. For most standard documents, aim for a score of approximately 70 to 80. </p>
				<p>The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level score rates text on a U.S. grade-school level. For example, a score of 5.0 means that a fifth grader, i.e., a Year 6, average 10 years old, can understand the document. For most standard documents, aim for a score of approximately 5.0 by using short sentences, not by simplifying vocabulary.</p>
				<p>In cases were a higher reading age is required (such as for a legal document) provide an easy to read summary of key points.</p>

				<h3>Provide rapid and direct feedback.</h3>
				<p>Applications should continuously provide easily-recognizable feedback of success or failure with every action. Confirm that after a user action the user known that the action was successful or not. Applications should also let the user know what just happened and where they are in a process. </p>
				<p>Spoken feedback is often more effective then written feedback. However having both spoken feedback and longer lasting written and visual feedback helps the user know where they are and restores the context if attention is lost.</p>
				<p><strong>For example: </strong></p>
				<ul>
				  <li>After a button is clicked it should look depressed</li>
				  <li>After a form is submitted there should be feedback saying what just happened such as &quot;your form was submitted, thank you &quot; or &quot;your email was sent&quot;. </li>
				  <li>After a step is completed the breadcrumbs have a tick next to that step's name and give the title of the next step</li>
	  </ul>

			<h3>Help meaning</h3>
			<section>
				<h4>Include short tooltips on all icons, jargon</h4>
				<p> Tooltips should be precise and relate directly to the object.</p>
				<p>When possible  tooltips should be able to be turned off via personalization. This is because  they may not be noticed by some who have severe aphasia and a visual agnosia and could add clutter and even confuse if they are read out by a screen reader or text to speech support. But for those with less severe difficulties they can be helpful.</p>
				<section>
				<h5>Explanation and who it helps:</h5>
				<p>The amount of help offered by tooltips very much depends on the ability of the user as do many of the techniques above. </p>
				<p> These is helpful to most persons with intellectual disabilities. Sometimes a person with an intellectual disability can get confused and distracted. If tooltips are to be used they must precise and relate directly to the object.</p>

				<h4>Use of charts and graphs</h4>
				<p> Where appropriate, create charts and graphics to provide additional ways to reinforce important concepts. Typically, if something can be shown in a chart or a graphic, it will help many users if it is provided.</p>
				<p>However, graphics should be clear and easy to identify what is going on</p>
				<p> The ability to “read between the lines” of a text, graphic, or lecture may seem like an exercise in “common sense,” but it may create barriers for students with autism, who may not be able to readily discern the intended relevance of graphical data.</p>
				<p> Clear explanations may reduce undue cognitive loads for all users.</p>
				<p>Further use aria-describedby to associate the graphic or sections of a graphic or chart and the text that describes it can be read by a screen reader whilst the right section of the chart is highlighted.</p>
				<section>
				<h5>Explanation and who it helps:</h5>
				<p>People  who find reading or language difficult can be helped by a chart or graph</p>

					<p>However as some people have difficulty remembering symbols, use text with the symbol.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Use clear symbols that can easily be seen and expanded</li>
						<li>Use images understood by different users</li>
						<li>In left to right languages place the image to the left of the text</li>
					</ul>
					<p>In the future we intend to enable semantics that will add symbols that are easy to use by the individual user.</p>

              <h4 >Use of synchronized highlighting, of complex graphics and formula with speech</h4>
              <p> Associate maths, sections of math and sections of complex items with explanations. </p>
              <p>Provide text or speech explanations for sections of   charts, mathematical formula and graphics, so that the section of the   formula or graphic being discussed can be highlighted at the same time   as the explanatory text is being read. </p>
              <p>For example, when the text is describing the denominator of a formula, that denominator should be highlighted. </p>
              <p>Note that this requires an accessible format for math such as MathML used with  aria-describedby and CSS.</p>
              <p>This has been shown to increase math comprehension by 10%

              <h4>Temperature</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Use the default temperature format of locale </li>
                <li>Allow reading of long form temperature. </li>
                <li>Reinforce with non-numerical values, e.g., Very Cold, Cold, Cool, Mild, Warm, Hot, Very Hot.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>These are subjective values and may not always be helpful especially when dealing with weather and ambient temperature (due to reasons such as variances in regional average temperature – what is considered hot in UK is considered cool in India or Thailand). It may be possible to use look up tables and JSON to query relative average temperature based upon locale and adjust temperature ranges accordingly. </p>
              <p>Give additional hints and pointers to users to give context.</p>
              <p>Explanation and who it helps</p>
              <p>The requirement to convert between Centigrade and Fahrenheit and vice versa is burdensome so defaulting to the format of the locale removes one layer of complexity.</p>
              <p>Reading the values long form rather than using figures is helpful in for the same reasons outlined in the dates and calendar section.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p></p>
              <h5>Examples</h5>
              <p>Even with all of the above in place a person may not be able to marry up the concept of temperature with the numbers so giving additional hints may help make the link to whether something is hot or cold.</p>
              <p>Use symbols where appropriate for example for weather the symbols used such as sun, snowflake, sun &amp; cloud will give some indication. </p>
              <p><strong>Pass example</strong>: The Temperature is Five Degrees Centigrade (Cold) <img src="img/SnowFlake.png" height="67" width="61" alt="" style="margin: 0px auto;"> hint: It’s hat and scarf weather. </p>
              <p><strong>Failure example</strong>: Failure to explain figures representing relative values. Temperature = 21&#x2103;/70&#x2109;</p>
              <p>The Temperature is Thirty Degrees Centigrade (Very hot) <img src="img/sun.png" height="62" width="62" alt="" style="margin: 0px auto;"> hint: It’s shorts weather </p>

              <h4>Ability to have mathematical notation read out with text to speech to aid understanding.</h4>
              <p>Explanation and who it helps</p>
              <p>The reading of Maths notation can be achieved through the use of MathML with text to speech but Maths reading rules need to be applied for the correct reading order and formats may be localized.  Correct localization and use of MathML for text to speech reading aloud with text highlighting can help with memory difficulties when coping with complex equations for those with Dyscalculia, dyslexia and attention deficit disorder. </p>

              <p>People with dyscalculia frequently struggle with the concept of quantities, this presents challenges when buying goods. In the failure example below it would be easy for someone with dyscalculia to think that the 25Kg was the smaller of the two.</p>

              <h4>Functions</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Allow use of E-Wallets  and password management tools.</li>
                <li>Avoid asking people to enter credit card details.</li>
                <li>Allow pasting of password and payment details into form fields.</li>
                <li>Avoid additional layers of password authentication (e.g., verified by Visa or time sensitive random security numbers).</li>
              </ul>
              <h4>Format</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Break up card input forms to match credit cards, e.g., 4x4 numbers.</li>
                <li>Different cards have different patterns of numbers e.g. Amex may have more numbers than Standard Cards.  Payment forms usually ask the user for the type of card. The card input form should reflect the payment card type.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Explanation and who it helps</p>
              <p>People may struggle remembering card numbers or may have difficulty entering numbers in the correct order due to sequencing issues. Multiple layers of authentication compound problems and many banks require two-factor authentication that uses pass codes that time out after 30 seconds.  Reducing the requirement for this will be of great benefit to people with dyslexia, dyscalculia, anyone who has poor working memory or issues with sequencing.</p>

              <p>User can copy and paste information into form fields.</p>
              <p><strong>Failure examples</strong></p>

                <h3>Formats for Numbers and Time</h3> <section>
                <h4>Time</h4>
        
            Check use of appropriate punctuation between numbers when providing times as these may be read inappropriately by text to speech engines. 
            <section><h5>Explanation and who it helps:</h5>
            <p>Being able to hear the numbers for time repeatedly read out aloud accurately with ‘text to speech’ technologies can help comprehension and memory.  Developers need to be aware of how these technologies react to time formats.  This feature can provide those with dyscalculia, dyslexia and attention deficit disorder and those who may be under high cognitive load or situationally disabled with a better understanding of the concepts. </p></section>
            <h5>Example</h5>
            <p>The international standard notation for the time of day is hh:mm:ss but this can be hard for those with cognitive impairments to fully comprehend – 10:30:10  may be read out as 10 hours, thirty minutes and 10 seconds by most text to speech engines but may be too long to remember.  The ISO advises the 24 hour clock for example 13:30 as opposed to 01.30pm - the latter is localized for English speakers but may help those with learning disabilities along with symbols to represent the period in the day such as suggest under calendars. </p>
            <p><strong>Pass example:</strong> Numbers representing time can be read out accurately by text to speech engines.</p>
            <p><strong>Failure examples:</strong>Numbers fail to be read out accurately by text to speech engines. </p>

    <h4>Layout for Numbers</h4>
    
    <p>
          Check use of white space and punctuation characters between numbers. Use of spaces and commas within numbers can confuse and text to speech engines cope in different ways.
    </p><section>
    <h5>Explanation and who it helps</h5>Where any numbers are presented their use needs to be considered.  If they are representing dates, time, references, telephone numbers or mathematical notation their layout impacts on users’ understanding.  Users need to not only recognize standardised layouts but also to be able to understand the meaning as the numbers are read aloud by text to speech engines. This feature can provide those with dyscalculia, dyslexia and attention deficit disorder and those who may be under high cognitive load or situationally disabled with a better understanding of the concepts.</p></section>
            <h5>Example</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Reference numbers compared to a quantity or value e.g.  Ref: 7241500 as opposed to 7,241,500 chickens </li>
                <li>Telephone numbers have localized layouts and text to speech readers cope in different ways with the layout so a telephone symbol and/or word for telephone/mobile/cell phone alongside the number can help avoid confusion. </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Pass example:</strong> Numbers representing specific concepts can be recognised by their layout as well as being read out accurately by text to speech engines.</p>
            <p><strong>Failure example: </strong>Numbers fail to conform to recognised layouts and are not read out accurately by text to speech engines. </p>
   </section><section>
        
          <h5>Roman Numerals</h5> 
          Roman Numerals should be presented in upper case if used in isolation.
            <p><strong>Explanation and who it helps</strong></p>
            <p>Roman Numerals can be presented as lower case or upper case especially when used with musical notation but these may not always be recognised by text to speech engines or may be confused with other navigational elements such as numerical bullet points. Use of Roman Numerals are not always easily understood.  The use of this format for isolated numbers impacts on comprehension for those with dyscalculia, dyslexia and attention deficit disorder and should be avoided if possible. </p>
            <h5>Examples</h5>
            <p>Text to speech engines will try to read the lower case Roman Numeral as word e.g. vi instead of VI – read as /vie/ instead of six.</p>
            <p><strong>Pass example: </strong>Roman Numerals presented in upper case if used in isolation.</p>
            <p><strong>Failure example: </strong>Roman Numerals presented in lower case in isolation.</p>
            <p>Use for tags: dyscalculia, dyslexia and attention deficit disorder.</p>

            <h4> Use linear horizontal text based scales for questionnaires and surveys rather than numbers.</h4>
            <p>Explanation and who it helps</p>
            <p>It has been found that using linear text positioned horizontally on a page can enhance the results where numerical like rating scales are used to carry out research into people’s views on a subject.  Using simple text is also important as this can help those with dementia and cognitive learning disabilities as well as those with dyscalculia, dyslexia, attention deficit disorder. </p>
            <h5>Examples</h5>
            <p>Rather than having a scale of 1-5 where one is poor and 5 is excellent use the words across the page just under the question and it has also been shown that using the higher rating scale first can also impact positively on the results. </p>
                <input type="checkbox" name="excellent" value="excellent"> excellent
                <input type="checkbox" name="very good" value="very good" > very good
                <input type="checkbox" name="good" value="good"> good
                <input type="checkbox" name="fair" value="fair"> fair
                <input type="checkbox" name="poor" value="poor"> poor      
            <p>Pass example: Offering users of a survey or questionnaire an alternative format.</p>
            <p>Failure example: Failure to offer users of a survey or questionnaire an alternative format.</p>

            <h4>Relative values</h4>
            <p>Note: This is not clear.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Relate percentages to part of a set and avoid comparing percentages to fractions. </li>
                <li>Avoid comparing the value of one item against another where the values are relative.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Explanation and who it helps</p>
            <p>Real concepts can be understood rather than abstract numbers  Using an absolute value is better than comparing values in such a way that an item when compared to another may appear to have a difference in value.  Use of imagery and/or text best supports this concept.  This also applies to relative sizes, quantity and distance.  These ideas support those with dyscalculia, dyslexia and attention deficit disorder and those who may be under high cognitive load. </p>
            <h5>Examples</h5>
            <p>Half an apple may be better understood when compared to 50% or <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub></p>
            
            <p>If one compares two statements showing prices it is likely the second option appears better value despite the cost of the fish and chips being unchanged. </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Fish and Chips: $15, Grilled Chicken: $7</li>
                <li>Grilled Chicken: $29, Fish and Chips: $15</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Pass examples</strong></p>
            <p>Relative values offer an alternative or explanation.</p>
            <p><strong>Failure examples</strong></p>
            <p>Failure to explain figures representing relative values.</p>
            <p>Use for tags: dyscalculia, dyslexia, attention deficit disorder.</p>

				<h4>Prevent errors</h4>
		    <p>Where possible prevent the user from making errors and needing to fix them</p>
			  <ul>
					<li>Require as little information as possible. Make it visually clear what information is required</li>
					<li>Provide instructions</li>
					<li>Accept as many formats as possible, such as different ways of writing a phone number and date formats</li>
					<li>Correct errors in the back-end, such as the post code being written in the text field with the city or state information</li>
					<li>Provide a summary before submitting important information. Make it one click to repair information</li>
					<li>Users often confuse advertisements and native content. Put advertisements in a box clearly marked as &quot;advertisement&quot;. Keep advertisement septate from native content.</li>
					<li>Users often forget about the scroll. Put any important features, such as save and send, above the scroll.</li>
					<li>Never trick the user into buying or agreeing to something that they did not understand, or create a price structure that is unclear. For example, <ul>
							<li>never increase the number of items (such as having a default of two) if the user may not notice</li>
							<li>never have hidden charges that are only brought to the users attention after they have given their credit card information. All charges must be clear before the start of the transaction task.</li></ul>
				  <li>Calendars and dates</li>
                            <ul>
                              <li>Calendars should default to the first relevant day. Work calendars should default to first working day of a user's locale. </li>
                              <li>Calendar based booking systems must avoid ability to book return date before departure date. </li>
                              <li>If the user tries to select an invalid date it must be clear why a date can not be selected such as with a short clear and friendly error message (for example &quot;sorry that date has passed). This avoids abandonment of the process.</li>
                              <li>Use terms that describe the present past and future days rather than just using numbers or dates. By using terminology such as ‘today’, ‘tomorrow’ or ‘travel now’ in the appropriate language for the locale, the user has a clear understanding of the timeliness of the event, booking or occasion.  </li>
                              <li>Display long form of <strong>dates</strong> with punctuation, e.g., June 1st, 2015 or 1st June, 2015. This offers a clear understanding of the date. Punctuation helps the text to speech API read the date in a way that is easier to follow.</li>
                              <li>When using numbers for time - check use of appropriate punctuation between numbers when providing times as these may be read inappropriately by text to speech engines.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <Li>Temperature</li>
                            <ul>
                              <li>Use the default temperature format of locale. The requirement to convert between Centigrade and Fahrenheit and vice versa is burdensome so defaulting to the format of the locale removes one layer of complexity.</li>
                              <li>Allow reading of long form temperature. Reading the values long form rather than using figures is helpful in for the same reasons outlined in the dates and calendar section.</li>
                              <li>Reinforce with non-numerical values, e.g., Very Cold, Cold, Cool, Mild, Warm, Hot, Very Hot. These are subjective values and may not always be helpful especially when dealing with weather and ambient temperature (due to reasons such as variances in regional average temperature – what is considered hot in UK is considered cool in India or Thailand). It may be possible to use look up tables and JSON to query relative average temperature based upon locale and adjust temperature ranges accordingly. </li>
                              <li>Give additional hints and pointers to users to give context.</li>
                            </ul></li></ul>

                            <h4>Examples</h4>
                            <h5>Example</h5>
                            <p>Currently many web based calendars require settings to be changed to suit the locale.  Users may not be aware of the start of the week in the locale e.g. Sunday in the Middle East and be unable to take appropriate actions to suit their needs.</p>
                            <p><strong>Pass example: </strong>Calendar settings recognize locale and/or offer the ability to edit settings</p>
                            <p><strong>Failure example: </strong>Incorrect punctuation and poorly localized date layout.</p>
                            <h5>Example</h5>
                            <p>The booking form provides two calendars and user is able to select dates without warning as to whether they are possible e.g. flight out on June 1st – flight return May 30th.</p>
                            <p><strong>Pass example:</strong>User is unable to select inappropriate dates and/or simple explanation provided should he/she do so. </p>
                            <p><strong>Failure example: </strong>User can select inappropriate dates without warning.  Calendar merely grays out inappropriate dates which may not be noticed.  No warnings provided. </p>
						
					
			      <h5>Example</h5>
			      <p>The booking form provides the option to select a short series of terms such as ‘today’ or ‘tomorrow’ as well as presenting a calendar.  This can speed booking times for those who have failed to organize their booking times in advance as well as those with dyscalculia, dyslexia and attention deficit disorder and those who may be under high cognitive load or situationally disabled. </p>
                  <p><strong>Pass example:</strong> User is able to select text based terms for days near to the appropriate booking times not just calendar dates. </p>
                  <p><strong>Failure example: </strong>Only calendar provided</p>
                  <h5>Example</h5>
                  <p>In USA the month appears before the day which is reversed in UK e,g 06/01/2015 or 01/06/2015. Further dyslexics and other user groups will not often confuse the order.</p>
                  <p><strong>Pass example:</strong> Month is given in text with numbers for date and year.</p>
                  <p><strong>Failure example: </strong>A series of numbers for the date.</p>
                  <h5>Example</h5>
                  <p>The international standard notation for the time of day is hh:mm:ss but this can be hard for those with cognitive impairments to fully comprehend – 10:30:10  may be read out as 10 hours, thirty minutes and 10 seconds by most text to speech engines but may be too long to remember.  The ISO advises the 24 hour clock for example 13:30 as opposed to 01.30pm - the latter is localized for English speakers but may help those with learning disabilities along with symbols to represent the period in the day such as suggest under calendars. </p>
                  <p>Being able to hear the numbers for time repeatedly read out aloud accurately with ‘text to speech’ technologies can help comprehension and memory.  Developers need to be aware of how these technologies react to time formats.  This feature can provide those with dyscalculia, dyslexia and attention deficit disorder and those who may be under high cognitive load or situationally disabled with a better understanding of the concepts.</p>
                  <p><strong>Pass example: </strong>Numbers representing time can be read out accurately by text to speech engines.</p>
                  <p><strong>Failure example:</strong> Numbers fail to be read out accurately by text to speech engines. </p>
              
				<h5>Example </h5>
				<p>Even with all of the above in place a person may not be able to marry up the concept of temperature with the numbers so giving additional hints may help make the link to whether something is hot or cold.</p>
				  <p>Use symbols where appropriate for example for weather the symbols used such as sun, snowflake, sun &amp; cloud will give some indication. </p>
				  <p>Pass example: The Temperature is Five Degrees Centigrade (Cold) <img src="img/SnowFlake.png" height="67" width="61" alt="" style="margin: 0px auto;"> hint: It’s hat and scarf weather. </p>
				  <p>Failure example: Failure to explain figures representing relative values. Temperature = 21&#x2103;/70&#x2109;</p>
				  <p>The Temperature is Thirty Degrees Centigrade (Very hot) <img src="img/sun.png" height="62" width="62" alt="" style="margin: 0px auto;"> hint: It’s shorts weather </p>

                <p><strong>Pass example:</strong> Use of MathML for maths notation http://www.w3.org/TR/MathML/ . Aria described by is used to sync any text describing sections of equations.</p>
                <p><strong>Failure example:</strong> Use of symbols as graphics without explanations.</p>
                <p>Use for tags: dyscalculia, dyslexia, attention deficit disorder.</p>

			  <h4>Help The User  orientate themselves, and  Regain focus when it is lost</h4>
		      <p>Using visual grouping, white space and clear structure will help the user focus Having headings and feedback will also help the use orientate themselves inside the content. (see techniques on  structure and feedback for clear details.) </p>
		      <p>Even with the clearest layout, the user will sometimes lose focus and forget what they are doing. This happens more and more in todays world of wearable technology and multi tasking. However for many people with cognitive disabilities this can also happen despite their best efforts to work or complete a task without interruptions. </p>
		      <ol>
		        <li>Providing headings and titles that orientate the user </li>
		        <li>Providing a summary of what the user has already completed. Examples include a text summary or breadcrumbs. </li>
	          </ol>
		      <p>Summaries of completed steps or content learned must contain any relevant key points necessary to know where you are and what you are doing. </p>
		      <h4>Failure example </h4>
		      <p>The following breadcrumbs do not help adequately the user know what they are doing</p>
		      <pre>step 1 &gt;&gt;  step 2 &gt;&gt; <strong>step 3</strong></pre>
		      <h4>Pass example </h4>
              <p>The following breadcrumbs reminds the user  what they are doing</p>
              <pre>step 1 - ordered 15 products &gt;&gt;  step 2 -  payment information &gt;&gt; <strong>step 3</strong> <strong>- shipping information</strong></pre>
		      
		      <p>Make the  breadcrumbs clickable so the user can click on them to find out more, such as what products were bought. Also this should allow the user to undo any errors and check their work. (See techniques on preventing errors.) The user must  then be able to jump back to the current page without having to redo additional steps.</p>

			    <h5>Explanation and who it helps:</h5>
	          People living with dementia or MCI will often forget what they were doing. Attention deficit disorder also affects the ability to focus on a task. Those with aphasia may have visual and audio perceptual difficulties and be confused by sudden interruption and distracting happenings. Attention may be poor and there is a need to have time and space to concentrate on the task in hand. </section>

  <h3>Minimize the cognitive skills required to use the content when there is a known alternative</h3>
<section>
					<h4>Explanation and who it helps:</h4>
					<p>Most user interfaces are designed to help users complete tasks. However, sometimes  they can introduce barriers   that are not necessary for using the content. </p>
					<p>When an author makes design choices that mean people who could have used their content now can not, that content is not accessible. </p>
	  </section>
  <p><strong>Examples in security: </strong></p>
				<p>Web security and privacy technologies, for example, intentionally require users to perceive more and to do more   to complete tasks. Three examples of these technologies are passwords, <abbr title="Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart">CAPTCHA</abbr>, and 2-Factor Authentication. Such techniques require that the user has a good working memory or short term memory required to copy a code or  remember complex passwords.				</p>
				
				  <p>Alternatives exists that can alow more people to use content securely. These alternatives include using Web tokens, signing in via email account or face book, or biometrics are all alternatives to the above. For more details on this  issue and on alternatives are available https<a href="https://rawgit.com/w3c/coga/master/issue-papers/privacy-security.html" target="_blank">://rawgit.com/w3c/coga/master/issue-papers/privacy-security.html</a></p>
  </div>
				
				<div>In voice  systems this may include,</div>
				<div>
				  <ul>
				    <li>Requiring the user to understand categories,</li>
				    <li>Requiring the user to remember numbers</li>
				    <li>can all be used as a barrier to getting human help</li>
			      </ul>
  </div>
				<div>is is avoidable by having 0 as a reserved digit to access a human</div>
				<div><br>
  </div>
				<div>In the Web of things this may include:</div>
				<div>
				  <ol>
				    <li>remembering what symbols mean</li>
				    <li>remembering sequences to run certain tasks</li>
			      </ol>
  </div>
				<div>This is avoidable by having simple text with symbols and </div>
				<div>clear discoverability of how o complete each task</div>
				<div>and recoverability from errors</div>

				<h3>Limit the number of features and choices on the same screen.</h3>
				<p>Do not provide many features, choices and options on the same screen. Limit to around 2 -5 key options. Put additional options under a "more options" sub-menu or enable them to be hidden.</p>
				<p>One technique will be to use   aria attribute of aria-importance. This allows the user agent to remove unwanted features.</p>
				<p>For example:  &lt;button aria-importance= "critical"&gt;send&lt;/button&gt;</p>

				<p>Add symbols to key content that help the user understand the meaning. </p>
				<h5>Calendar</h5>
                When time is included in a calendar use clear icons or simple text to represent occurrences that may be repeated such as certain times of day for example icons for sun rising, sun past midday and sun going down or text such as morning (am) for 9-12 or afternoon for 1-4 (pm) etc. This technique can be applied to other items such as months and days if appropriate. 
                <p>Explanation and who it helps</p>
                <p>By using simple symbols and/or text that can be an addition to numbers helps those who may be confused by times in the morning looking the same as a time in the evening if the am or pm is not noticed or the 24 hour clock causes problems.  6:30am and 6.30pm   0906 and 1906 or 1609.  Increased use of symbols can help those with receptive aphasia as well as other cognitive learning disabilities not just those with dyscalculia, dyslexia or attention deficit disorder. </p>
              <h5>Examples</h5>
                
              <h6>Example</h6>
              <p>Using a symbol such as 0900 or 1300 <img src="img/TimeSamples.png" height="50" width="114" alt="2 suns, each representing a clock and with an arrow pointing to a time position" style="margin: 0px auto;"> along with the time – these symbols may be seen in a column along the side of the calendar.</p>
                <p><strong>Pass example:</strong> Icons or symbols are used to denote repeated times within the calendar as an addition to times and / or text. </p>
                <p><strong>Failure example</strong>: Only numbers for time included in a calendar where there are repetitions. </p>
                
				<p>Note that an alternative technique will be to use   aria attribute of aria-function. This allows the user agent to add a symbol.</p>
                <p>For example: &lt;button type="button" aria-function=&quot;undo&quot; &gt;default&lt;/button&gt;</p>

				<h3>Use semantics to provide extra help</h3>
				<p>One technique will be to use   aria attribute of aria-function. This allows the user agent to add symbols and extra help.</p>
                <p>For example: &lt;button type="button" aria-function=&quot;undo&quot; &gt;default&lt;/button&gt;</p>
                <p>Other aria semantics can be used to provide direct help:</p>
                <p>aria-feedback= "your email was sent" </p>
                <p>aria-explain= "this item costs more"</p>
                <p><span>&lt;span aria-numberfree=&quot;almost all&quot;&gt;9 out of 10</span> &lt;/span&gt; </p>
                <p>Using standard HTML tags is also useful, such as </p>
