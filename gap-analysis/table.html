<h1>Gap Analysis - Tables of User Needs </h1>
<p>This section is work in progress for  tables format for the coga roadmap. It identifies user needs that are not currently fully addressed by accessibility.</p>
<p>Each  table addresses a group of user needs represented by   a few related user stories of the form of "As a <em>&lt;role&gt;,</em> I want <em>&lt;goal/desire&gt;</em> so that <em>&lt;benefit&gt;</em>".</p>
<p>The tables show how  related user needs can be met though:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Authoring techniques for content using HTML,</li>
  <li>How this can be addressed in WCAG </li>
  <li>New semantics that may be required to address this user need, such as extra aria attributes</li>
  <li>Any personalization requirements</li>
  <li>Operating System support or other support that may be required to meet this user need</li>
</ul>
<p>Note we also have the summary at https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/cognitive-a11y-tf/wiki/Gap_Analysis_Summary#Summary_of_Issues</p>
<p><strong>Please note that this table is incomplete and is a work in progress. (We are publishing it early to solicit early feedback.</strong>) For a later version see ....</p>

				<h3> Table 1: Authentication </h3>
				<p><strong>About the user:</strong> Many people (most COGA groups) have memory issues that can make copying text, or remembering passwords, difficult or impossible. Other contributing issues include impaired executive function. </p>
				<p>Sometimes security and authentication put a barrier between the user and the task that they are doing so that the user can not use the content or service.  For example, difficult security mechanisms that require coping or remembering passwords often bar people with cognitive disabilities from accessing content or using a service at all. </p>
				<p>This leads to following user stories:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>As a user who has memory impairments and often forget passwords I need to be able to use a site without remembering or copying  passwords and user names so that I can use this service.</li>
					<li>As a user who has weak executive function I need the   login process to be simple and not multi step so that I can use it.</li>

				<h3>Table 2: Context and distractions</h3>
				<p><strong>About the user:</strong> Distractions can cause people with cognitive disabilities to lose focus on the current action being performed or draw attention away from the primary content and can be difficult for some users to know how to understand, avoid and/or stop them. </p>
				<p>Once people have become distracted it can be difficult for them to remember what they were doing. This is especially problematic for people with both low attention and impaired memory such as people with dementia.</p>
				<p>This leads to following user stories: To do - fill in user stories</p>
				<p><strong>User needs</strong></p>
				<ul>
					<li>I need to consume content or complete a task without unnecessary distractions. </li>
				    <li>I need to turn off distractions 1) to       be a default and 2) to be a trivial option in real       time.</li>
				
                  <li>I need to know the context, were I am, and what I just did, or what happened to me.</li>
                  <li>I need to restore the context when I forget where I am or get distracted.</li>
                  <li>I need to restore the context in       multi media . I       need to go back to that bit I just missed, or re-orientate myself if  I lost       the context.</li>

				<h3>Table 3: Entering data, error prevention &amp; recovery </h3>
				<p>About the user: Filling out forms and similar tasks can be overwhelming for most people with cognitive and learning disabilities. This includes relatively minor learning disabilities such as dyslexia or attention related disabilities. Many people (most COGA groups) have memory issues that can make copying text, difficult or impossible. Other contributing issues include impaired executive function. </p>
				<p>Many  people learning disability can not  remember numbers such as their post code, Social Security or Credit Card  numbers. Many people even need  to  check their phone number. This makes  entering information slow, and they may need to leave their desk or take a  break.</p>
				<p>Many users find it very difficult to copy information, due to low visual memory or impaired executive function.</p>
				<p>This  leads to the following  user stories:</p>
                <ul type="disc">
                  <li>As a user who needs to look up my       postal code I do not want the session       to time out while I try  to find the information needed.</li>
                  <li>As a user who needs to take  breaks during       tasks like filling in a form,       I want to be sure all my work is saved automatically if my computer       crashes so that  I do       not have to start over again, (which can create a cycle and each time I       reenter my data  I am       more ti red and more likely to make       mistakes).</li>
                  <li>As a user with difficulty typing       numbers in the right order,       I want an interface that makes mistakes less likely.</li>
                  <li>As a user who finds entering       information stressful, I want to enter as little       information as I can so that it is manageable.</li>
                </ul>
<p><strong>User Needs</strong></p>
				<ul>
					<li>I need help avoiding mistakes and minimize the mistakes I might make. </li>
					<li>I need to know what mistake I made and how to correct a mistake. It does not scare me I need to make the correction easily. </li>
					<li>I need enough time, and  not lose my work. </li>
					<li>I want to use applications or API's that remember a lot of my information so I do not need to enter it again. </li>
					<li>I want to know where I am in a process. </li>
					<li>I want to be able to check my work and go back without losing the work I have just done. </li>

					<li>I need symbols that help me understand. </li>
					<li>I need graphs and pictures supplement text so that I can understand the point without a lot of reading. </li>
					<li>I need speech support with synchronized highlighting so I can follow as I go I need rapid feedback. </li>
					<li>I need reminders or I will forget appointments and when I was meant to do things. </li>
					<li>I do not want too many reminders as they I will be distracted. </li>
					<li>I want to be confident that I can manage my task. </li>

				<h3>Table 5: Simple and clear interface </h3>
				<p><strong>About the user:</strong> Many people can not learn easily new design metaphors or remember things that they learned (such as people with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or dementia. Without these skills it can be much harder or impossible to locate a desired items to interact with and know what interaction may do. The user can feel lost or overwhelmed. </p>
				<p>Many users can be overwhelmed by too many options, or too much information. If reading is slow then two much information mixed together will make it difficult or impossible to find the information you need.</p>

				<h3>Table 6: Familiar interface</h3>
				<p><strong>About the user:</strong> Many people cannot learn easily new design metaphors or remember things that they learned (such as people with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or dementia. Without these skills it can be much harder or impossible to: </p>
				<ul>
					<li>locate desired items to interact with and </li>
					<li> know what the interaction may do</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Using a familiar design, terms and symbols is key to being able to use the web for people who cannot remember new symbols (such as some people with memory related impairments like dementia). Therefore the user needs things to be familiar including:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>location of elements</li>
					<li>symbols </li>
					<li>text used</li>
					<li>how to get help</li>
				</ul>
				<p> However what is familiar for one user may be new for another. So the interface needs to be familiar to the individual user.</p>

              <h3>Table 8: Navigating the system</h3>
              <p>About  the user: Many people (most COGA groups) have memory issues  and/or  language issues that can make remembering numbers while  processing  words, difficult or impossible. Other contributing issues include  impaired executive function. </p>
              <p>Sometimes developers put a barrier between the user and the task that they are doing so that the user can not use the content or service.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Voice XML enable  voice dialogs systems and voice browsers. Sometimes the user needs to hold  multiple pieces of transitory information in their  mind, such as the number that is being  presented as an option,  whilst processing the terms that follow.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>This leads to following user stories:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>As a user who has memory impairments and weak language processing skills I want to be able to get help without going though a voiceML menu system so that I can set an appointment or find out some information</li>
                <li>As a user who has weak executive       function. I need the process to get help       to be simple and not multi step so that I can use it.</li>
                <li>A user can have trouble identifying the right words to say in a voice menu.</li>
              </ol>
