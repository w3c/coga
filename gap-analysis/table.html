<h1>Gap Analysis - Tables of User Needs </h1>
<p>This section is work in progress for  discussion of the tables format for the COGA roadmap. It identifies user needs that are not currently fully addressed by accessibility.</p>
<a id="userneeds" ></a><strong>User needs:</strong> Each  table addresses a group of user needs. The tables show how  related user needs can be met. 
<ul>
  <li>Each row starts with a user needs in the first column that need to be addressed</li>
  <li><a id="WCAGex" ></a>The second column in each row describes how users need could be addressed in  the next version of WCAG. It gives the names of the relevant success criteria proposals. For the full text , see  current at <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/cognitive-a11y-tf/wiki/SC_To Do_list">WCAG  COGA SC and To Do List</a></li>
  <li><a id="authoring" ></a>The third column describes examples of authoring techniques that may support users need or WCAG success criteria, see  <a rel="nofollow" href="https://rawgit.com/w3c/COGA/master/techniques/index.html">COGA authoring techniques document.</a>, or
 the appendix on making content accessible for people with learning and cogitative disabilities.</li>
  <li><a id="semantics" ></a> The fourth column describes new semantics that may be required to address this user need, such as extra ARIA attributes. See the draft for a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/personalization-semantics-1.0/">Personalization Semantics</a> (that may become a WAI-ARIA [[wai-ARIA]] module), and personalization syntax and vocabulary to enable adaptable interfaces. </li>
  <li><a id="personalization" ></a>The fifth column describes any personalization requirements. Please see the discussion on Why we need personalization. (to-do add link)</li>
  <li><a id="operating" ></a>The last column describes operating system support or other support that may be required to meet this user need.</li>
</ul>
<p>users needs are also represented by   a few related user stories in the form of "As a <em>&lt;role&gt;,</em> I want <em>&lt;goal/desire&gt;</em> so that <em>&lt;benefit&gt;</em>".</p>
	<p>Note we also have an <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/cognitive-a11y-tf/wiki/Gap_Analysis_Summary#Summary_of_Issues">issue summary</a></p>
<p><strong>Please note that this table is incomplete, and is a work in progress. (We are publishing it early to solicit early feedback.</strong>) </p>

				<h3 id="table1"> Table 1: Authentication and Safety</h3>
				<p><strong>About users:</strong> Many users (most COGA groups) have memory issues that can make copying text, or remembering passwords, difficult or impossible. Other contributing issues include impaired executive function. </p>
				<p>Sometimes security and authentication put a barrier between users, and the task they are doing, so that users cannot use the content or service.  For example, difficult security mechanisms, which require coping or remembering passwords, often bar users with cognitive disabilities from accessing content or using a service at all. </p>
				<p>This leads to following user stories:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>As a user who has memory impairments and often forgets passwords, I need to be able to use a site, without remembering or copying  passwords and user names, so that I can use this service.</li>
					<li>As a user who has  impairments,  I need to be able to use a site without being required to copy items in the correct sequence.</li>
					<li>As a user who has weak executive function, I need the   login process to be simple, and not multi-step, so that I can use it.</li>
					<li>As a symbol user, I  need a   login process I can use.</li>
				</ol>

				<p><strong>About users:</strong> Distractions can cause users with cognitive disabilities to lose focus on the current action being performed, or draw attention away from the primary content, and can be difficult for some users to know how to understand, avoid, and/or stop them. </p>
				<p>Once users have become distracted, it can be difficult for them to remember what they were doing. This is especially problematic for users with both low attention and impaired memory, such as users with dementia.</p>

Currently, users can turn off  distractions, such   as Skype  and Facebook, across different devices, and then may forget   to turn them back on. This idea manages all distractions by forming a   cross-application and cross-device distraction matrix that manages all   distractions in one setting.</p></td>

			  <h3 id="table3">Table 3: Entering data, error prevention &amp; recovery </h3>
				<p>About users: Completing forms and similar tasks can be overwhelming for most users with cognitive and learning disabilities. This includes relatively minor learning disabilities, such as Dyslexia or attention related disabilities. Many users (most COGA groups) have memory issues that can make copying text difficult or impossible. Other contributing issues include impaired executive function. </p>
				<p>Many  users with learning disabilities cannot  remember numbers such as their post/zip code, Social Security, or Credit Card  numbers. Many users even need  to  check their phone numbers. This makes  entering information slow, and they may need to leave their desks or take breaks.</p>
				<p>Many users find it very difficult to copy information due to low visual memory or impaired executive function.</p>
				<p>This  leads to the following  user stories:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>As a user who needs to look up my       postal/zip code, I do not want a session       to time out while I try  to find the information needed.</li>
                  <li>As a user who needs to take  breaks during       tasks such as completing a form,       I want to be sure all my work is saved automatically if my computer       crashes. I do       not want to have to start over again, which can create a cycle of reentering my data; and making me more tired and more likely to make       mistakes.</li>
                  <li>As a user with difficulty typing       numbers in the right order,       I want an interface that makes mistakes less likely.</li>
                  <li>As a user who finds entering       information stressful, I want to enter as little       information as I can so it is manageable.</li>
                </ul>
<p><strong>User Needs</strong></p>
			  <ul>
					<li>I need help avoiding mistakes, and minimizing the mistakes I might make. </li>
					<li>I need to know what mistake I made, and how to correct a mistake. It does not scare me I if I can make the correction easily. </li>
					<li>I need enough time, and  not lose my work. </li>
					<li>I want to use applications or APIs that remember a lot of my information so I do not need to enter it again, and to otherwise help me, such as with spelling. </li>
					<li>I want to know where I am in a process, including what i have done and what my next step is. </li>
					<li>I want to be able to check my work and go back without losing the work I have just done. </li>

  <h3 id="table6">Table 6: Familiar interface</h3>
				<p><strong>About users:</strong> Many users cannot easily learn new design metaphors, or remember things they learned, such as users with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or dementia. Without these skills, it can be much harder or impossible to: </p>
				<ul>
					<li>locate desired items to interact with; and </li>
					<li>know what the interaction may do.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Using a familiar design, terms and symbols are key to being able to use the web for users who cannot remember new symbols (such as some users with memory related impairments like dementia). Therefore, users need things to be familiar including:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>location of elements;</li>
					<li>symbols; </li>
					<li>text used;</li>
					<li>how to get help.</li>
				</ul>
  <p> However, what is familiar for one user may be new for another. So the interface needs to be familiar to the individual user.</p>
				<p>This  leads to the following  user stories: </p>
				<ul>
				  <li>I am familiar with the UI, and I       know how to work it and what will happen when I work it. </li>
				  <li>Content delivered in an       easy-to-understand mode. </li>
				  <li>Simple content with few options       and consistent text . </li>
				  <li>I find the content easy-to-use. </li>

              <h3 id="table8">Table 8: Navigating the system</h3>
              <p>About  users: Many users (most COGA groups) have memory issues  and/or  language issues that can make remembering numbers, while  processing  words, difficult or impossible. Other contributing issues include  impaired executive function. </p>
              <p>Sometimes developers put a barrier between users and the task they are doing so users cannot use the content or service.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Voice XML enables  voice dialog systems and voice browsers. Sometimes users need to hold  multiple pieces of transitory information in their  minds, such as a number being  presented as an option, while processing terms that follow.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>This leads to the following user stories.</p>
              <ol>
                <li>As a user who has memory impairments and weak language processing skills, I want to get help, without going though a Voice-ML menu system, so I can set an appointment or find out some information.</li>
                <li>As a user who has weak executive       function, I need a process to get help       to be simple, and not multi-step, so I can use it.</li>
                <li>Users can have trouble identifying the right words to say in a voice menu.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>Note: Integrate the  issue paper on Voice ML.</p>
