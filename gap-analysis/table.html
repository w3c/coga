<body>

<p>This section is a work in progress for discussion of the tables format for the COGA roadmap. It identifies user needs that are not currently fully addressed by accessibility.</p>
<a id="userneeds" ></a><strong>User needs:</strong> each  table addresses a group of user needs. The tables show how related user needs can be met. 
<ul>
  <li>Each row starts, in the first column, with user needs to be addressed.</li>
  <li><a id="WCAGex" ></a>The second column in each row describes how user needs could be addressed in the next version of the WCAG. It gives the names of the relevant success criteria proposals. For the full text, see  current at <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/cognitive-a11y-tf/wiki/SC_To Do_list">WCAG  COGA SC and To Do List</a></li>
  <li><a id="authoring" ></a>The third column describes examples of authoring techniques that may support user needs or WCAG success criteria. See the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://w3c.github.io/coga/techniques/index.html">COGA authoring techniques document</a> or the appendix on making content accessible for people with learning and cognitive disabilities.</li>
  <li><a id="semantics" ></a> The fourth column describes new semantics that may be required to address user needs, such as extra ARIA attributes. See the draft for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/personalization-semantics-1.0/">Personalization Semantics</a> (that may become a WAI-ARIA [[wai-ARIA]] module); and personalization syntax and vocabulary to enable adaptable interfaces. </li>
  <li><a id="personalization" ></a>The fifth column describes any personalization requirements. </li>
  <li><a id="operating" ></a>The last column describes operating system support or other support that may be required to meet user needs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Users needs are also represented by a few related user stories in the form of "As a <em>&lt;role&gt;,</em> I want <em>&lt;goal/desire&gt;</em> so that <em>&lt;benefit&gt;</em>".</p>
	<div class="ednote"><p>The task force intend to update this section with: 
		<ul>
			<li>Updates due to changes in the personalization specification and the web accessibility guidelines, </li>
			<li>updates from new research, </li>
			<li>editorial changes and </li>
			<li>changes to make it easier to read and follow. </li>
		</ul> 
	We would like suggestions that could be used to make this section more understandable. </p>

	<p>There is also an <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/cognitive-a11y-tf/wiki/Gap_Analysis_Summary#Summary_of_Issues">issue summary</a>.</p></div>

				<h3 id="table1"> Table 1: Authentication and Safety</h3>
				<p><strong>About users:</strong> Many users (most COGA groups) have memory issues that can make transcribing text or remembering passwords difficult or impossible. Other contributing issues include impaired executive function. </p>
				<p>Sometimes security and authentication put a barrier between users and the tasks they are doing. For example, requiring remembering and/or transcribing passwords often bar users with cognitive disabilities from accessing content or using a service. </p>
				<p>This leads to the following user stories.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>As a user who has memory impairments and often forgets passwords, I need to be able to use a site, without remembering or transcribing  passwords and user names, so I can use its service.</li>
					<li>As a user who has  impairments, I need to use a site without being required to transcribe items in the correct sequence.</li>
					<li>As a user who has weak executive function, I need the   login process to be simple, and not multi-step, so I can use it.</li>
					<li>As a symbol user, I  need a login process I can use.</li>
				</ol>

				<p>About users: Completing forms and similar tasks can be overwhelming for most users with cognitive and learning disabilities. This includes relatively minor learning disabilities, such as Dyslexia, or attention related disabilities. Many users (most COGA groups) have memory issues that can make transcribing text difficult or impossible. Other contributing issues include impaired executive function. </p>
				<p>Many  users with learning disabilities cannot  remember numbers, such as those for their post/zip code, Social Security, or credit card. Many users even need  to  check their phone numbers. This makes  entering information slow, and they may need to leave their desks or take breaks.</p>
				<p>Many users find it very difficult to transcribe information due to low visual memory or impaired executive function.</p>
				<p>This  leads to the following  user stories.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>As a user who needs to look up my       postal/zip code, I do not want a session       to time out while I try  to find the information needed.</li>

  <h3 id="table6">Table 6: Familiar interface</h3>
				<p><strong>About users:</strong> many users cannot easily learn new design metaphors, or remember things they learned, such as users with mild cognitive impairment or dementia. Without these skills, it can be much harder or impossible to locate desired items to interact with, and to know what interactions may do. Users can feel lost or overwhelmed. </p>
				<p>Using a familiar design, terms and symbols are key to being able to use the web for users who cannot remember new symbols (such as some users with memory related impairments like dementia). Therefore, users need things to be familiar including:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>location of elements;</li>
					<li>symbols; </li>
					<li>text used;</li>
					<li>how to get help.</li>
				</ul>
  <p>However, what is familiar for one user may be new for another. So, the interface needs to be familiar to the individual user.</p>
				<p>This leads to the following user stories: </p>
				<ul>
				  <li>I am familiar with the UI, and I know how to work it and what will happen when I work it. </li>
				  <li>Content delivered in an easy-to-understand mode. </li>
				  <li>Simple content with few options and consistent text . </li>
				  <li>I find the content easy to understand. </li>
  </ul>

              <h3 id="table8">Table 8: Navigating the system</h3>
              <p>About  users: Many users (most COGA groups) have memory issues and/or language issues that can make remembering numbers, while  processing words, difficult or impossible. Other contributing issues include  impaired executive function. </p>
              <p>Sometimes developers put a barrier between users and the task they are doing so users cannot use the content or service.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Voice XML enables  voice dialog systems and voice browsers. Sometimes users need to hold multiple pieces of transitory information in their  minds, such as a number being  presented as an option, while processing terms that follow.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>This leads to the following user stories.</p>
              <ol>
                <li>As a user who has memory impairments and weak language processing skills, I want to get help, without going though a Voice-ML menu system, so I can set an appointment or find out some information.</li>
                <li>As a user who has weak executive       function, I need a process to get help       to be simple, and not multi-step, so I can use it.</li>
                <li>Users can have trouble identifying the right words to say in a voice menu.</li>
              </ol>
              <p><strong>Editors' Note:</strong> integrate the  issue paper on Voice ML.</p>
